# *Welcome to Bitcoin Chattanooga!*

<img class="desktop-only" src="/images/Logos/Bitcoin%20Chatt%20Avatar.png" style="width:16dvw;float:right;">

We promote businesses that accept bitcoin for payments, offer free Bitcoin education, and connect Chattanoogans with opportunities to work and build their savings using bitcoin.

We do these by providing:

### Free Advertising for Businesses that Accept Bitcoin

<p style="margin-left: 2rem;">Bitcoiners aren't investors looking to make more dollars; <b>they're revolutionaries who hope for a freer world without borders or boundaries.</b> They tend to favor businesses that accept bitcoin, so we're here to connect them with those businesses.</p>

### Bitcoin Workshops, Open to All

<p style="margin-left: 2rem;">If you're nervous about using Bitcoin, our free and open workshops are here to help you through that. Or, <a href="/contact">contact us</a> to schedule a free, in-person consultation that will get you started with Bitcoin. If you prefer to be self-taught, check out our <a href="/new-to-bitcoin">New to Bitcoin</a> page to get started!</p>

### Temporary Jobs, Paid in Bitcoin

<p style="margin-left: 2rem;">With 39% of Chattanoogans facing financial instability<sup><a target="_blank" href="https://unitedwaycha.org/financial-stability-and-our-greater-chattanooga-community/">1</a></sup>, Bitcoin Chattanooga will set up temporary job opportunities that will allow you to get paid in bitcoin, build long-term savings, and learn vital skills, while simultaneously improving our community.</p>

Together, we’re onboarding Chattanooga to the future of money. <i>Nothing stops this train!</i>

<br>

## Our Story

<img class="mobile-banner" src="./Bitcoin-Chatt-at-Moxy-April-2022.jpeg" style="width:20dvw;float:left;">

<br>

Bitcoin Chatt began as a humble meetup on <a href="https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000004730cacd16909b9e2323eeceab1305c31edae2af07537">October 1, 2021</a>, where local Bitcoiners built friendships and educated curious visitors. In January 2025, Bitcoin Chattanoga's Founder, Jason Sellers, visited El Salvador—the first nation to adopt bitcoin—and saw the hope that Bitcoin gave to the people there, which had spread from a small beach town there, to become a national phenomenon. Inspired, he returned to replicate that transformation here.

Time will tell how quickly this train moves toward its destination, but you can play an important role in our efforts to make the future one of liberty and personal responsibility, of savings and hope, and of peace and prosperity. You can start today by [learning all about Bitcoin](/new-to-bitcoin), accepting bitcoin at your business—<i>we'll freely promote you on social media and at our events, and also include you on our [map](/map)—</i>or by asking the businesses you visit to start accepting it.

If you'd like to schedule a free consultation, or be notified of upcoming workshops, opportunities to earn bitcoin, and other events, [tell us](/contact), and we'll include you in our email list. Also, please consider [supporting](/donate) us, but even spreading the word will help us build a freer, thriving Chattanooga.

<p style="margin-left: 2rem;">David began studying bitcoin in 2021. From podcasts, to YouTube, articles and finally able to meet up with the awesome group of people at Bitcoin Chatt. 
Him and his family left California for South Dakota in late 2019, to be closer to family and escape to a ‘Free State’. After 2 years there, opportunity knocked and landed them in Tennessee.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2rem;">He founded a nonprofit that focused on helping the less fortunate. The nonprofit was funded by recyclables that were donated and redeemed for fiat, hence the name, ‘Reaching by Recycling’. He attributes his success to God and an amazing team.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2rem;">Robert first bought bitcoin in 2021 as an attempt to keep up with the crushing inflation caused by the government bailouts of the last 20 years. Bitcoin has no issuer and cannot be debased, which means his hard earned savings cannot be stolen by good intentioned politicians. Robert moved to Tennessee with his family in 2023.
