## Our Story

<img src="./Bitcoin-Chatt-at-Moxy-April-2022.jpeg" style="width:20dvw;float:left;">

<br>

Bitcoin Chatt began as a humble meetup on October 1, 2021, where local Bitcoiners built friendships and educated curious visitors. In January 2025, Founder Jason Sellers visited El Salvador—the first nation to adopt bitcoin—and saw the hope that had spread from a small beach town there, to become a national phenomenon. Inspired, he returned to replicate that transformation here.

Time will tell how far we go, but you can play an important role in our efforts to make the future one of liberty and personal responsibility, of savings and hope, and of peace and prosperity. Accept bitcoin at your business and be included on our [map](/map), [join](/join) our service projects, [donate](/donate) to keep us going, or simply spread the word—your support will lead to a freer, thriving Chattanooga.

<p style="margin-left: 2rem;">Jason, Bitcoin Chatt’s Founder and Executive Director, discovered Bitcoin in 2015, and spent years learning about it through audiobooks and podcasts while working in package delivery. In 2018, he found he had a passion for Bitcoin education, and created online groups to teach others about it.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2rem;">From 2022 to 2023, Jason led community growth at <a href="https://www.noah.com/">NOAH</a>, which designed a wallet app for those in developing countries to use bitcoin. He was then the Community Manager at the Spirit of Satoshi, a Large Language Model built on all Bitcoin knowledge, making it the ultimate AI expert on the topic.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2rem;">In early 2024, Jason published <a href="https://a.co/d/0mcMtUC">"21 Questions: A Beginner's Guide to Bitcoin"</a>, a book that offers reliable answers to the top 21 Bitcoin-related questions from some of the most knowledgeable voices in the space. He was also the Ambassador Concierge at <a href="https://www.satlantis.io/">Satlantis</a>, a social app with Tripadvisor capabilities, until February 2025, when he left to focus all his time on building Bitcoin Chatt.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2rem;">Jason and his wife Leigh Ann live in Rossville, Georgia, with their 6 homeschooled children. Follow him on both <a href="https://www.x.com/geekigai">Twitter/X</a> and <a href="https://njump.me/npub1693220pmp0a4c04a0p7hkz874vsxkyfrvtk2yk4zjyj3e4c0ugjs3r4j0c">Nostr</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2rem;">David began studying bitcoin in 2021. From podcasts, to YouTube, articles and finally able to meet up with the awesome group of people at Bitcoin Chatt. 
Him and his family left California for South Dakota in late 2019, to be closer to family and escape to a ‘Free State’. After 2 years there, opportunity knocked and landed them in Tennessee.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2rem;">He founded a nonprofit that focused on helping the less fortunate. The nonprofit was funded by recyclables that were donated and redeemed for fiat, hence the name, ‘Reaching by Recycling’. He attributes his success to God and an amazing team.</p>

### John Holler

<p style="margin-left: 2rem;">John took the Orange Pill in 2020 as he watched the COVID insanity unfold and trillions of fiat dollars get created out of thin air. He also took the Cow Pill, and in 2022 started a regenerative farm with his wife, Kathryn, and two other households. Their farm is <a target="_blank" href="http://beecreektn.com/">Bee Creek Farm</a> in Crossville, TN and they prefer payment in bitcoin!</p>

### Robert B.

<p style="margin-left: 2rem;">Robert first bought bitcoin in 2021 as an attempt to keep up with the crushing inflation caused by the government bailouts of the last 20 years. Bitcoin has no issuer and cannot be debased, which means his hard earned savings cannot be stolen by good intentioned politicians. Robert moved to Tennessee with his family in 2023. He has a passion for personal finance, spending less than he earns, and helping families preserve their assets.</p>
