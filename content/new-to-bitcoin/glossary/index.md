      <h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="address">
Address
      </h3>
    </summary>
A Bitcoin address is a unique code used for receiving bitcoin on-chain. It looks like a long string of letters and numbers, and is generated from your <a href="#public-key">public key</a>, to add a layer of privacy to your bitcoin transactions. For example: <b>bc1qnn35dt7vr4s7yxdpytknjxx5u66ex8033uk797</b>

      <h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="ark-protocol">
Ark Protocol
      </h3>
    </summary>
The Ark Protocol is an in-development additional layer on the Bitcoin Timechain that aims to scale bitcoin usage by pooling users’ UTXOs into shared off-chain transactions, managed by a node-runner of your choice, who has no power over your funds. As of early 2025, it’s still in testing, but it promises to blend speed, privacy, and compatibility with other second layer solutions like the Lightning Network.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
      <h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="block">
Block
      </h3>
    </summary>
A block is a collection of Bitcoin transactions bundled together, like a page in a shared, permanent digital ledger, added to the Timechain roughly every 10 minutes by miners.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
      <h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="block-height">
Block Height
      </h3>
    </summary>
Block height refers to the total number of blocks in the Timechain, counting from the very first one (Block 0, known as <a target="_blank" href="https://mempool.space/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f">the Genesis Block</a>), up to the latest. Each block marks a fixed and unalterable point in time, with a verifiable record of transactions up to that point, so the block height is often used to truthfully pinpoint the exact moment of an event in recent history (for example, the first Bitcoin Chattanooga meetup began at block 703083).
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
      <h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="block-reward">
Block Reward
      </h3>
    </summary>
The block reward is the new bitcoin that miners earn when they successfully prove that they found a correct large number through energy expenditure (see Nonce and Proof of Work), and they add a block to the Timechain. From January 2009 to November 2012, the reward of new bitcoin for each block was 50 bitcoin; from November 2012 to July 2016, the reward was 25 bitcoin; from July 2016 to May 2020, the reward was 12.5 bitcoin; from May 2020 to April 2024, the reward was 6.25 bitcoin; and from April 2024 to the present, the reward is 3.125 bitcoin with ever new block, or approximately every 10 minutes. This 4-year "halving" pattern will continue until roughly the year 2140, when the last Satoshi will be mined.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>
      <h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="coinbase">
Coinbase
      </h3>
    </summary>
The coinbase is the first transaction in every block. It includes the new bitcoin awarded to the miners, as well as the fees attached to every on-chain transaction. <b>Note:</b> this coinbase is distinct from the popular exchange by the same name, which we do not recommend using, despite its popularity.
  </details>

<details>

<summary>

<h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="cold-storage">Cold Storage</h3>

</summary>

Cold storage means keeping your bitcoin offline—think of it as a digital vault—using devices or paper that aren’t connected to the internet, making it nearly impossible for hackers to reach.

</details>

<details>

<summary>

<h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="consensus">Consensus</h3>

</summary>

Consensus is the agreement among Bitcoin nodes worldwide on the rules and the current state of the Timechain, ensuring everyone’s copy matches without needing a central boss.

</details>

<details>

<summary>

<h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block"  id="cryptograpy">Cryptography</h3>

</summary>

Cryptography is the mathematical wizardry that locks your bitcoin away from prying eyes, using one-way functions that are easy to verify but nearly impossible to crack without your private key.

</details>

<details>

<summary>

<h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="custodial-wallet">Custodial Wallet</h3>

</summary>

A custodial wallet is one where a third party, like an exchange, holds your private keys for you, meaning you’re trusting them to keep your bitcoin safe instead of controlling it yourself.

</details>

<details>

<summary>

<h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="decentralization">Decentralization</h3>

</summary>

Decentralization is Bitcoin’s superpower—no single person or group runs the show; it’s powered by users worldwide, making it resistant to control or shutdown.

</details>

<details>

<summary>

<h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="difficulty-adjustment">Difficulty Adjustment</h3>

</summary>

Every two weeks, Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment tweaks how hard it is for miners to find new blocks, keeping the average time between them at 10 minutes regardless of how many miners join or leave.

</details>

<details>

<summary>

<h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="dont-trust-verify">Don’t Trust, Verify</h3>

</summary>

“Don’t Trust, Verify” is a Bitcoin mantra urging you to check the Timechain yourself—ideally with your own node—rather than relying on someone else to confirm your transactions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>

<h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="ecash">eCash</h3>

</details>

<details>

<summary>

<h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="get-on-zero">Get On Zero</h3>

</summary>

"Get <i>On</i> Zero" hearkens to the phrase "Get <i>Off</i> Zero", and is a reference to the concept of getting onto zero fiat, or being 100% allocated to bitcoin. After all, if you have one foot in the lifeboat and the other on the Titanic, are you really safe from the sinking fiat system?

</details>

<details>

<summary>

<h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="halving">Halving</h3>

</details>

<details>

<summary>

<h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="soft-fork">Fork, Soft</h3>

</summary>

A soft fork tweaks Bitcoin’s rules in a way that’s still compatible with older nodes, tightening the system without splitting the Timechain.

</details>

<details>

<summary>

<h3 class="align-left" style="display: inline-block" id="hash">Hash</h3>

Public Key
      </h3>
    </summary>
A public key is a long code of letters and numbers, derived from your private key, which others can use to send you bitcoin. It's safe to share since no one can reverse-engineer your private key from it, but it's recommended that you use a receiving <a href="#address">address</a> instead, for better privacy.
