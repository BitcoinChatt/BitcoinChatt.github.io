<h1 style="text-align:center">New to Bitcoin?</h1>

<h2 style="text-align:center">You’ve come to the right place!</h2>

Getting started with Bitcoin isn’t like picking up a new gadget or app—it’s a bigger leap, and the stakes can feel much higher. Many have hesitated because a misstep would be costly, and others are just not sure where to begin. If that’s you, you’re not alone, and this is exactly why Bitcoin Chatt exists. <b>We’re here to demystify Bitcoin, ease your worries, and walk alongside you as you jump onboard this game-changing money.</b>

If you prefer learning in person, our free workshops are open to everyone! Just hop over to our <a href="https://www.bitcoinchatt.org/join">Join</a> page to connect with the team and sign up for our newsletter, and RSVP for an upcoming event on our <a href="https://www.bitcoinchatt.org/calendar">Calendar</a>. 

But if you’d rather take a self-guided approach, you’re in the right spot. On the following pages, we’ll guide you through the basics of economics and Bitcoin, and also point you to the best educational resources elsewhere on the internet. And if you’d like to suggest something we missed, share it with us on our  <a href="https://www.bitcoinchatt.org/contact">Contact</a> page so we can add it.

<h1 style="text-align:center">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<br>

## "Am I Too Late?"

<br>

<br>

<br>

People have been asking this since Bitcoin’s early days, convinced they’ve missed the train, but here’s the good news: <b>No, you’re not too late!</b> Bitcoin is the future of money, not a casino for getting rich quick, so it isn’t about getting into it at the perfect time—it’s about how long you can stay aboard. As the investment guru Kenneth Fisher put it, “Time <i>in</i> the market beats tim<i>ing</i> the market.” History shows that holding bitcoin for at least 4 years is long enough to see it grow in value, no matter when you start.

<br>

<br>

<br>

Why 4 years? Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins (each one divisible to a hundred-millionth, or even smaller if needed), while demand keeps rising as education spreads. When increasing demand meets Bitcoin’s unchangeable limit, prices trend up and to the right—though not without a few dips along the way. Every 4 years or so, the rate of new bitcoin being mined is cut in half, so the same (or rising) demand must then chase after half the amount of new coins.

<br>

<br>

This leads to a cycle of new highs, burnout, and cooldown, while usually remaining higher than the peaks of the previous round. So don’t think of Bitcoin as a way to get more dollars, but as a way to escape rising prices in the dollar system, and the ultimate savings vehicle. We’re still <i>incredibly</i> early in Bitcoin’s overall adoption—roughly only 3% of the world’s population has adopted it—so it has plenty of room to grow to the upside!

## "What About Other Cryptocurrencies?"

<br>

At Bitcoin Chatt, our focus is only on Bitcoin (BTC), and here’s why: Bitcoin stands alone as the only money—crypto or otherwise—with everything you’d want in a currency (more on that in the following pages). There are millions of other “cryptos” designed to muddy the waters and prey on the unaware; they churn out tokens with no real value, ripe for insider trading and gambling. If that’s your thing, fine; it’s just not part of the purpose of Bitcoin Chatt.

<br>

<br>

<br>

Bitcoin is different. It has no CEO, no headquarters, and no fancy foundation pulling strings. It’s owned and run by us—its users—built from the ground up to replace the broken banking system, not reinvent a worse version of it like cryptos do. Ben Perrin, the host of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BTCSessions">BTC Sessions</a>, explained it perfectly: “With fiat, only one entity can print money; with crypto, anyone can print money; with Bitcoin, <i>no one</i> can print money.” That’s the level of integrity that Bitcoin represents, which is why we’re laser-focused on it.
