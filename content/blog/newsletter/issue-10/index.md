### Bitcoin Chatt Joins the Tennessee BitcoinÂ Alliance!

On Wednesday, July 9th, BitcoinÂ Chatt's Founder, JasonÂ Sellers, attended the launch party for the [Tennessee Bitcoin Alliance](https://www.tnbitcoinalliance.org/), an initiative to turn the state of Tennessee into a leader in Bitcoin adoption. Jason will continue working with it to educate lawmakers and the general public about Bitcoin, and help onboard individuals, businesses, and even our elected officials to the future of money.

<br>

This type of development is often met with mixed feelings among Bitcoiners. After all, isn't Bitcoin supposed to *separate* money and state? Why are we celebrating and encouraging political leaders getting into Bitcoin, when Bitcoin is all about rules without rulers?

Part of the reason is simply that this is an inevitability: eventually, *everyone* will own bitcoin, as each person, company, and political party gets some at the prices they each deserve. Additionally, this will not give the state more power, but is actually part of their capitulation to a power that will forever be greater than them, namely Bitcoin.

So when a politician starts using bitcoin, understand that rather than this being another action that givesÂ them more power, it's anÂ action that representsÂ their submission to the unbreakable laws of physics, mathematics, and immutable code. It's just another essential step in freedom's unstoppable march to victory.

### Bitcoin Hits New All Time Highs!

Also on Wednesday, July 9th, Bitcoin's price barely surpassed its previous all time high of $112,000. And then on Thursday and Friday, it *blasted* past that point, to reach a new all time high (as of the writing of this newsletter)Â of just under $119,000. Due to the rate of newly mined bitcoins being cut in half approximately every 4 years, Bitcoin's price experiences a massive bull market aboutÂ every 4 years, so these current moves have been expected, and are happening right on time.

<br>

Past bull markets ended with *extreme* enthusiasm and upward momentum, but we're nowhere near that right now. Of course, no one knows the future, so this timeless wisdom still holds true: *treat your bitcoin like a long-term savings account, for money that you don't plan to touch for at least 4 years.* As you learn more about Bitcoin's inherent benefitsâ€”like its absolute scarcity, its censorship resistance, and the ease of taking custody ofÂ it yourselfâ€”you'll see why demand for it will always rise, and why as that ever-rising demand meets Bitcoin's fixed supply, its price can only go up, on a long enough time scale. That's whenÂ you'll realize thatÂ Bitcoin is the only escapeÂ from the collapsing fiat system, and then you'll never look back.

### Introducing GLOK: the Essential Safety App for Bitcoiners

Last Monday, July 7th, a new app for Bitcoiners was [announced on X](https://x.com/GlokApp/status/1942164642450543012) and [Nostr](https://primal.net/e/nevent1qqspx6p954pjdu0dwzklsv4l8wfcxwk5kezmv6yphcfnv0rzjmjglzqddcme8), called [GLOK](https://glok.me/) (not to be confused with X's AI, G*r*ok). Since Bitcoin's inception, many methods have been employed to attempt to steal bitcoin from those who hold it. From malware to phishing attacks, it seems likeÂ thieves have tried everything, and their techniques have evolved as Bitcoin has grown in price, usage, and security. But when all else fails, desperate attackers have been known to resort to [using pure force](https://xkcd.com/538/) on someone to get them to give up their private key. Using a multi-sig walletâ€”a wallet app that requires at least 2 separate private keys in order to access and send any of the bitcoinâ€”can help mitigate againstÂ this, but even if it keeps your bitcoin safe, it may not stop you from getting hurt, or worse.

<br>

That's where GLOK comes in. [GLOK](https://glok.me/announcing-glok-the-next-chapter-in-bitcoiners-arms-race/) is an open source, private, Nostr-native geolocation app that enables youÂ to instantly call for help when you find yourself in a potentiallyÂ dangerous situation. It doesn't track you when you don't need help, but as soon as you press the big red button in the app, it pinpoints your phone's location and immediately alerts your list of family andÂ friends in the app, so they can come to your rescue. It's still in development, but you can sign up to be among their first users at [glok.me](https://glok.me/).

Your Bitcoin Tip

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

Whether you're just getting started with Bitcoin, or you've been using it for some time, a great wallet to use is one called [Manna Wallet](https://mannabitcoin.com/). This is a new type of wallet that integrates on-chain bitcoin, the Lightning Network, and the Liquid Network in one app, with one unified balance. It's self-custodial, open source, and allows you to choose your own Lightning Address (i.e., "[your username here]@mannabitcoin.com"), which looks like an email address, but is used for receiving bitcoin over the Lightning Network. We talk about Lightning on our [Intro to Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/new-to-bitcoin/intro-to-bitcoin/) and [How to Use Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/new-to-bitcoin/how-to-use-bitcoin/) pages, and we'll go intoÂ it more in future newsletters, but what exactly is the *Liquid* Network?

<a href="https://liquid.network/" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Liquid Sidechain.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

The Liquid Network is known asÂ aÂ "sidechain", and while it's *connected* toÂ Bitcoin's blockchain, it's separate fromÂ it. Liquid isÂ designed to make Bitcoin transactions faster and more private, without needing to create and manage channels, as one needs to do when usingÂ Lightning self-custodially. Instead, users to lock their bitcoin in a transaction on the main blockchain, and create an equal amount of "Liquid Bitcoin" (L-BTC) on Liquid's ledger. These L-BTC can then be sent quickly and privately on the Liquid sidechain, with the option to unlock them on Bitcoin's foundational ledger later. Unlike Bitcoin's main blockchain, Liquid uses a different system and a smaller group of participants to confirm transactions, which speeds things up and hides the amounts being sent.

Several wallet apps, like [Manna](https://mannabitcoin.com/), [Aqua](https://aqua.net/), and [CoinOS](https://coinos.io/), use Liquid's sidechain as a bridge between the main blockchain and the Lightning Network. This gives the walletÂ greater interoperability with other wallets, as well as privacy and simplicity without having to manage one's own Lightning channels. And in the case of wallets like Manna, Aqua, and [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com/app/) (formerly "Green Wallet"), it also givesÂ the user complete custody over their funds. ThisÂ  often means the wallet needs toÂ take an additional fee when sending or receiving bitcoin, but that's a small price to pay for simplicity, interoperability, and self sovereignty.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

Several weeks ago, back in Issue 003 of his newsletter, I wrote a summary of the discussion we had at the Bitcoin Chatt meetup on May 17th. In it, IÂ explained that the discussion turned toward how IÂ plan to continue supporting my family whileÂ the Bitcoin Chattanooga nonprofit isn't receiving many donations. IÂ said that IÂ knew when IÂ would need to start looking for a job to pay the bills, first as something part-time,Â alongside my efforts with Bitcoin Chatt, and then as a complete full-time replacement, should that ever be needed. Fortunately, it still has not reached that point. But a very flexible, part-time opportunity presented itself (cleaning AirBNBs on a very flexible schedule), which will not only allow me to extend the time that I'll be able to keep the nonprofitÂ running, but may also be the first step in a larger goal that IÂ have for Bitcoin Chattanooga.

The end goal for BitcoinÂ Chatt has always been and will always be turning the Chattanooga area into a Bitcoin circular economy, but this goes far beyond teaching locals about Bitcoin and freely advertising for businesses that start accepting it for payment. There's another problem that Bitcoin solves, but that many aren't yet able to take advantage of:Â saving for the future. Recent surveys have shown that roughly 40%Â of people in the Chattanooga area have no savings at all, and are living paycheck-to-paycheck. They're literally just *one* layoff, *one* recession, or *one* bad management change away from complete destitution. They could start getting paid in bitcoin and pay for everything with bitcoin, but after all is paid for, they'd still have nothing left overÂ to save with.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Litter Pick Up.jpeg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

That's why my plan is to start an initiative as part of Bitcoin ChattanoogaÂ that I'm callingÂ *"Proof of Work"*. My idea is toÂ provide access toÂ short-term "gigs"â€”like picking up litter inÂ a park or along the side of a highwayâ€”that people can do on the side, and get paid for it with bitcoin. It would be an extra source of income that could go straight to their savings, KYC-free. Or, if someone needs fiat right away so they can pay off an outstanding bill, they can opt to get paid with dollars, instead. With everything else I've been working on, though, I wasn't sure how IÂ was going to start this Proof of Work initiative, but now my own "side hustle" of cleaning AirBNBs once on a flexible basisÂ *might* end up kickstartingÂ this initiative. The owner of the cleaning company has told me she's very interested in learning more about Bitcoin, so it looks promising!

We needÂ to remember that the most important thing about BitcoinÂ isn't the technology, or even how we can use it to save for our ownÂ futures;Â it's about how it can affect the lives of those with the greatest needs in very real ways. In other words, ***if we're not fixing the money in orderÂ to fix the world by first fixing the lives of individuals around us, then what are we fixing the money for?*** There are many people who would love to start hodling bitcoin, but life's circumstances are preventingÂ them from being able to do so. Part of BitcoinÂ Chattanooga's mission through "Proof of Work" is to help fix that for anyone willing to learn about Bitcoin andÂ do the work required to earn it.
