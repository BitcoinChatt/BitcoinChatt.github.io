### We're Teaming Up with the Nonprofit Resource Center!

Chattanooga's <a href="https://www.npresourcecenter.org/" target="_blank">Nonprofit Resource Center</a>, located at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/caYNSLz4aah2gynf7" target="_blank">5715 Uptain Rd, Suite 300</a>, in Chattanooga, is teaming up with Bitcoin Chattanooga! They'll spread the word about us to other nonprofits and local businesses, provide a classroom for Bitcoin workshops, and give us meeting spaces for free consultations about Bitcoin.

Stay tuned for announcements on when we'll host seminars and other events there! 👀

### The Bitcoin Remnant Meetup

One week from today, on June 7th, from 12-2pm, the Bitcoin Remnant meetup will take place at <a href="https://www.divinedesignnaturalhealth.com/" target="_blank">Divine Design Natural Health</a>, located at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/S9mttGZ5YprELi5V7" target="_blank">3800 Keith St NW, in Cleveland, TN</a>. Much like the Bitcoin Chatt meetups, Bitcoin Remnant is usually a round table discussion about Bitcoin and related topics. So whether you're new to Bitcoin or a long-time hodler, this is a great meetup to attend!

Why is it called the Bitcoin Remnant? The "remnant" can be thought of as "the cream of the crop", or those who have been prepared for greater light and truth, and are scattered and mixed among the still sleeping masses. Bitcoin is for the remnant—those who recognize that something is wrong with the world and are ready to take the orange pill—the masses will soon follow. If you think you're ready to dive deep down the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole, then this meetup is for you!

### Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas

<a href="https://b.tc/conference" target="_blank">The Bitcoin 2025 Conference</a> is happening right now in Las Vegas! If you've never been to a Bitcoin Conference before, it’s a great place to connect with other Bitcoiners, learn about new businesses in the space, and be present for some of the most exciting presentations. From May 27 through today, over *35,000* Bitcoiners from around the world are gathered together, sharing ideas and geeking-out about Bitcoin.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Bitcoin 2025.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

It's too late to be there in person, of course, but <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%23Bitcoin2025" target="_blank">Twitter/X</a> has lots of updates, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BitcoinMagazine" target="_blank">livestreams</a> will keep you in the loop. And with today being the final day of the conference, watch out for some big announcements that might change this space forever!

### Steak 'n Shake Saving 50% on Processing Fees! 🤯

As we reported previously, Steak 'n Shake hopped aboard the Bitcoin train a couple weeks ago, and it’s already paying off for them significantly! Their COO, Dan Edwards, had this to say at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference: *"Our experience so far with Bitcoin has been that it is* ***faster than credit cards,*** *and when customers choose to pay in bitcoin instead of credit cards,* ***we are saving about 50% in our processing fees."*** Bitcoin's Lightning Network is proving it can make transactions faster than cards, more convenient than cash, and more resilient than gold.

<a href="https://youtu.be/lesvQb9MyU4" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Steak n Shake Bitcoin Story.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

When businesses accept bitcoin, everyone wins: Businesses save on fees, Bitcoiners are one step closer to living on bitcoin, and more new users join the network and leave the dying fiat system behind. And Steak 'n Shake is showing everyone how to get this done.

### Square to Enable Bitcoin Payments Everywhere

Square recently dropped this bombshell <a href="https://block.xyz/inside/block-to-roll-out-bitcoin-payments-on-square" target="_blank">announcement</a>: they’re bringing Lightning Network payments to merchants *everywhere,* which means fast transactions and tiny fees for *everyone.* Whether you’re a shop owner or just want to live on your sats, this is about to make Bitcoin a *lot* more useful for everyday purchases—to say nothing of all the newly bitcoin-accepting businesses that we'll need to add to our [map](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/map/)! 😅

<a href="https://block.xyz/inside/block-to-roll-out-bitcoin-payments-on-square" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Square Accepting Bitcoin.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

Many merchants are likely still unaware of this news, so this will allow those in-the-know to cut costs and get more customers before those who are out of the loop. Square is updating the necessary infrastructure for this change, but if you own bitcoin and understand why it's important, then it's on you to prioritize these merchants over those who don't accept bitcoin yet. This could be the push that onboards much of the Chattanooga area to the future of money, so we're pretty excited about this, to say the least!

Local Business Spotlight
------------------------

Every week, we shine a spotlight on a business in the area that accepts bitcoin for payments. Given recent news, it should come as no surprise that this week's business is:

### Same Day Septic

Serving the entire Chattanooga area, <a href="https://www.samedayseptic.co/" target="_blank">Same Day Septic</a> is revolutionizing the septic service industry with its comprehensive, customer-focused solutions for homeowners and businesses. From routine septic tank pumping to emergency repairs, field line maintenance, and new installations, they ensure your system runs smoothly, preventing costly backups and health hazards. Their 24/7 availability and dedication to treating every customer like family make them a standout choice for reliable, high-quality service. By accepting bitcoin as payment, Same Day Septic aligns with the values of financial independence, appealing to those who seek to opt out of traditional systems while maintaining a healthy septic system.

<a href="https://www.samedayseptic.co/" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Same Day Septic.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

A testament to their exceptional service is what the founder of Bitcoin Chattanooga, Jason, experienced first-hand when he urgently needed work done on his home's septic tank a few months ago. While Same Day Septic was servicing a neighbor’s property, Jason approached them, described his issue, and requested a quote. The owner, JT, mentioned that they accept “all forms of payment,” including cash, card, check, and Venmo. When Jason half-jokingly asked, “***All*** forms? Even bitcoin?” JT enthusiastically replied, “Actually, yes!” Thrilled, Jason scheduled the job—which was completed promptly and expertly—and when it was complete, he paid for it with bitcoin.

Want us to feature *your* business? [Let us know](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/contact/) if you already accept bitcoin, or if you would like us to get you set up, and we'll feature your business in an upcoming newsletter, as well as on our [map](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/map)!

Your Bitcoin Tip

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

Bitcoin is not crypto. Many who are new to Bitcoin often treat them the same, or as if Bitcoin were a small subset of crypto. We've all made mistakes like this, so if you've done it, you're forgiven. This is an easy mistake to make, anyway, since Bitcoin uses a branch of mathematics called *cryptography.* And after many other failed attempts, it was the first cryptocurrency that worked, so why do we say that Bitcoin is not crypto?

Bitcoin was created to separate money and state, to free us all from monetary control and corruption at the very highest levels of society. The identity of its pseudonymous creator, "Satoshi Nakamoto", is still unknown today, and he has neither used his roughly 1 million bitcoin nor broken his silence since his last verified message in early 2011. He gave humanity a great gift—an incorruptible and perfectly scarce means of storing and transferring your time and energy—and then disappeared without a trace.

<a href="https://youtu.be/iIWViimqRMU" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Satoshi's Gift.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

After that, many saw Bitcoin's success and started replicating it with their own cryptographic "coins". But why? Once perfectly sound freedom money was available to all, reinventing it (and without the anonymity and altruistic disappearance of its creator) wouldn't do anything to further liberate humanity from oppressive regimes, so what's the point of making literally millions of copycats? To put it bluntly: with only a couple exceptions, **their purpose is to take money from new users who don't yet know any better.**

Ever since these coins entered the scene, they've gone by many names: "altcoins" and "shitcoins" are popular terms, but with the rise of less "coin-like" scams like ICOs and NFTs, the term "crypto" has been applied to all of them collectively. **These could not be more different from Bitcoin,** since Bitcoin was created to benefit everyone at no one's expense and with no one at the top, while "cryptos" were made to enrich their founders at the top, and at your expense.

<a href="https://youtu.be/TIkqBZnrKJM" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="shitcoins vs reality.gif" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

It has been said that **Bitcoin is to crypto what astronomy is to astrology:** they may appear related on the surface, but underneath they are diametrically opposed. We mean no offense if astrology is your thing, just as we mean no offense if you choose to gamble with cryptos; we only wish to clear up this confusion about Bitcoin and crypto. At Bitcoin Chattanooga, we're interested in encouraging freedom and personal responsibility, which is why we choose to focus only on Bitcoin.

Recommended Resource—*Double* Feature!
--------------------

Want to learn more about Bitcoin, but are unsure where to begin? You can always complete our [New to Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/new-to-bitcoin) course, but if you're looking for something different, here's our suggested educational resource for this week:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLjx0ha_6Qo&t=337s" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Bitcoin and the Beast.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

<a href="https://www.angel.com/watch/tuttle-twins" target="_blank">Tuttle Twins</a> is a children's show created <a href="https://www.angel.com/" target="_blank">Angel Studios</a>, based on children's books written by <a href="https://x.com/cboyack" target="_blank">Connor Boyack</a>. In these two episodes, Ethan and Emily Tuttle learn about Bitcoin, the history of money, why Bitcoin is the hardest money we have ever had, and how money—and everything it touches—is corrupted when it's centrally controlled. If you're looking for a simple explanation that a child could understand—with plenty of laughs along the way—then these episodes are for you!

And if you have kids and want to teach them basic principles of freedom, personal responsibility, and how the world works, check out all the other Tuttle Twins episodes <a href="https://www.angel.com/watch/tuttle-twins" target="_blank">here</a>!

Closing Thoughts
----------------

I often like to say that Bitcoin relies on 3 things: the laws of physics, mathematics, and game theory (or incentives, or human action, or whatever you want to call it). While all of these are strong and reliable, if there can be a weakness anywhere in this 3-legged stool, it'll be in the third leg.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Bitcoin 3 Legged Stool.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

For example, there have been many internal wars and schisms between Bitcoiners over the years regarding protocol upgrades, how Bitcoin ought to be used, whether institutional involvement is a good or bad thing, and many other topics. Currently, there's concern over mining centralization, contention surrounding transaction spam and competing node implementations, and others pushing complex ideas on how Bitcoin can be improved. 

But at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference this week, Ross Ulbricht—the creator of the Silk Road online merchant platform, who was given 2 life sentences plus 40 years without parole, until he was pardoned by President Trump earlier this year—gave a fantastic speech on the importance of 3 basic principles: **Freedom, Decentralization,** and **Unity.** I recommend you first listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JMYLjI7RgY" target="_blank">his speech from the Bitcoin 2021 Conference</a> (which he gave from prison, and which he was later punished for), and then watch his presentation from this year's conference, before continuing with my rant:

<a href="https://youtu.be/8ZZGRA-8ZMU" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Ross Ulbricht.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

The strength of this third leg that Bitcoin stands on, game theory, is entirely up to us. Every day, we get to choose how free, decentralized, and yet unified we want to be. I was recently thinking about the well-known quote from the late Charlie Munger: *"Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome."* I used to think that Bitcoin's incentive structure would inevitably produce outcomes of more freedom, decentralization, and unity, but I've since learned it's not that simple: our incentives are products of our values coming in contact with the world around us, so they're often unpredictable, even with something as unchangeable as Bitcoin.

Our differing values clash every time we interact, rubbing against others' values like sandpaper, and (hopefully) polishing us into better men and women. This can be very inconvenient in the short term, but fortunately, Bitcoin is not a democracy, waiting for a slim majority to agree on a change before it's imposed upon everyone else. Bitcoin is fundamentally anarchistic: you're free to run it the way you want to run it, and if you and I independently decide to run it similarly, great! But if not, that's fine, too. The market will show us who was right, and if we're humble enough (see last week's closing thoughts), then we'll change and unify over what we've discovered to be right.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Bitcoiner Enemies.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

For now, though, there isn't much unity among Bitcoiners (see above 😂). That should be expected from Bitcoin's rapid adoption over the last few years, but these kinds of growing pains can still be difficult to go through. My advice: *keep your eyes on the prize;* remember why Bitcoin is here, and remember what we're fighting for. Keep that in mind whenever controversies arise in this space, as they most certainly will. And then maybe, just maybe, we'll achieve the freedom, decentralization, and unity that Ross Ulbricht is calling for.

I'm praying and working for that future literally every day.

Jason
