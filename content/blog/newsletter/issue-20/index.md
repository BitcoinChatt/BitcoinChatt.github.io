### Bitcoin Chatt's 4th Anniversary Celebration!

October 1st will officially mark *4 years* since Bitcoin Chatt began, so join us the following Saturday, **October 4th, from 12-2 PM**, for Bitcoin Chatt’s 4th birthday party at the Bitcoin Remnant meetup! This event will be held at Divine Design Natural Health, at [3800 Keith St NW in Cleveland](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iyNjmLwFx6AB1SFeA), and will include healthy food, presentations and videos about Bitcoin and Bitcoin Chatt, and fun Bitcoin-themed games suitable for all ages.

<br>

At this party, we'll look back at key moments from the last four years, from only three people gathering in the Edney Building in downtown Chattanooga, to our current push to create a local Bitcoin circular economy in the area. Everyone attending will need to pay $10 in cash or bitcoin by the time you arrive, to cover the cost of the food. RSVP [here](https://www.meetup.com/bitcoin-chattanooga/events/310897229/) so we will know how many to expect, and help make this meetup one to remember!

### Vietnam's Central Bank Shuts Down 86 Million Accounts Over Biometric Refusals

On Monday, September 15th, Vietnam's central bank closed *over 86 million* bank accounts belonging to customers who refused to submit to facial scanning for biometric data collection. The move, aimed at enhancing "security" and tracking financial activity, left millions without access to their funds, sparking widespread outrage. Bank officials claim that these measures are meant to prevent fraud, but critics see it for what it is: massive overreach that is, itself, the very fraud they're claiming to protect their customers from.

<br>

**This is exactly why we need Bitcoin:** it's money that *only you* control (if you custody it yourself, which you should be), without needing permission from banks or governments. Even in the US, similar measures could be implemented under the guise of safety, but they're really about surveillance and potential seizure. Put another way, they're taking people's money while pretending to protect it from those who might take people's money. Bitcoin is how you opt-out of that fraud, so you can hold your wealth securely and privately, free from the chains of the fiat system.

### Fed Lowers Interest Rates by 25 Basis Points

On Thursday, the 18th, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced a 0.25% cut to interest rates, bringing the federal funds rate down to a range of 4.75%-5.00%. This means borrowing money becomes slightly cheaper for banks, businesses, and consumers, which is intended to stimulate spending and economic activity. However, it also signals concerns about slowing growth, as lower rates often aim to boost liquidity when the economy needs a push.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Fed Cuts Rate by 25 Basis Points.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

Historically, rate cuts like this devalue the dollar further through inflation, driving investors toward hard assets like bitcoin that can't be printed endlessly. With more money flowing into the system, Bitcoin's fixed supply makes each of its 21 million full coins (or 2.1 *quadrillion* sats) look like prime real-estate on Manhattan Island during the 1700s. So this change will likely push Bitcoin's price even higher in the weeks and months ahead as people seek protection from their savings being eroded. Are *you* ready for the next bull run?

Your Bitcoin Tip
----------------

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

Talking to others about Bitcoin can sometimes feel frustrating, especially when you're excited for the bright orange future ahead of us, but they don't want to hear about it. The key is to exercise empathy by listening to their concerns about the current state of the world, like rising costs or unstable jobs, rather than simply dropping facts on them. When you understand where they're coming from and the problems they already see, *only then* should you explain the flaws in the current fiat system, like how endless printing is devaluing their savings, banks are charging hidden fees, and governments can freeze bank accounts.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Bitcoin Solves Problems.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

Once they can clearly see the problems, introduce Bitcoin as the solution. You can describe it as digital gold, since it's perfectly scarce, borderless, and under *your/their* control, but also because using analogies often help new users feel less intimidated, so they understand Bitcoin better. Share real stories—especially your own, if you can—like how Bitcoin has been an escape hatch for people in high-inflation countries with despotic leadership. And make it relatable by referring back to the problems with the fiat system that they saw earlier.

To get them to start stacking sats, suggest that they start small. Many people still think they have to buy a *whole* bitcoin, and don't know that each bitcoin can be divided into 100 million sats, so $1 is worth around 870 sats at the time of writing. Recommend the best exchanges to them, like [River](https://river.com/signup?r=3ODI6556F4) or [the Bitcoin Well](https://www.bitcoinwell.com/referral/geekigai) for buying a little each week, emphasizing [dollar-cost averaging](https://dcabtc.com/) to avoid trying to time the market.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Secret and Safe.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

Stress self-custody from the very beginning, explaining that a private key is a set of 12 random words that they need to write down, and keep secret and safe. Guide them through setting up wallets like [Blitz](https://blitz-wallet.com/) or [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/), backing up their seed phrase offline, and showing them how easy it is to use bitcoin by sending small amounts. Patience is crucial; you will likely need to explain things multiple times, but focus on benefits like financial independence rather than on details about the technology.

For family or close friends, lead by example: show them how Bitcoin has improved your life, like reducing your worry about savings, confiscation, and surveillance. But above all, *avoid getting into pointless arguments.* If they push back, ask questions to better understand their concerns, and address them gently, if you can. Sometimes people need more time to digest what they've learned before they'll feel safe enough to take the leap down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. This video breaks it down perfectly, with a clear strategy for turning skeptics into believers by building trust first, and taking a "soft fork" approach to introducing new concepts, rather than a "hard fork" approach:

<br>

Remember, **orange pilling isn't about winning debates, but about planting seeds.** Follow up casually, share resources like educational books and short videos, and invite them to meetups. When they're ready, help them buy their first sats, and over time, as they see the purchasing power of their bitcoin rise, they'll be grateful that you took the time to give them a head-start into the future of money.

Recommended Resource
--------------------

Want to learn more about Bitcoin, but are unsure where to begin? You can always complete our [New to Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/new-to-bitcoin) course, but if you're looking for something different, here's our suggested educational resource for this week:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgEqfFHfNGs" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Bitcoin Way Speech.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

At [BTC Prague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgEqfFHfNGs) earlier this year, Tony Yazbeck, the Founder of [The Bitcoin Way](https://www.thebitcoinway.com/), gave us tangible, on-the-ground, real-world reasons for why everyone needs Bitcoin so badly. But he adds that simply buying Bitcoin and leaving it on an exchange is repeating the mistakes of the past that got us to where we are today. This is why taking self-custody of your bitcoin is the only way this revolution can move forward on a global scale, and make any real difference at the level of each individual.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

I've always been a bit of an evangelical when it comes to good things I discover that I think others would like, too. Ironically, I grew up as a Mormon, not an Evangelical, so I served a two-year mission for the LDS church, sharing many things that I believed at the time to be true (many of which I still believe today). Even after leaving that behind, I've spent years inviting people to discover Jesus in new ways. And for the last decade, I've added Bitcoin to the mix, urging others to embrace it as a powerful way to escape the slavery of fiat. For most of my life, I've been involved in trying to convince those I meet of something profound, but it has often felt like pulling teeth—or worse, like taking to a brick wall.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Nocoiner Brick Wall.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

Yet, I've learned (and relearned, and relearned, and...) that forcing the conversation rarely works. When I let go and stop pushing so hard, the people who are truly ready for the truths I cherish start appearing in my life, and those moments become far more impactful. It's easy to disregard those who reject Bitcoin with a "Everyone buys bitcoin at the price they deserve," and while that's true, it's important to remember that some people just need more time, and that's okay. When you focus less on persuasion and more on genuine connection, everything aligns and turns out alright in the end.

The video below is a little silly, but it does a good job capturing this sentiment. The truth is that people rarely shift their views just from receiving new facts, because they first need to feel safe enough to make the change we're encouraging:

<br>

So while I have no plans to hold back with orange pilling, I'm also committing to making an extra effort to understand others' fears and hopes, and getting around the egos that so often keep us (including myself) from learning or reaching our potential. As explained in today's Bitcoin tip, the path to hyperbitcoinization starts with empathy, but then it progresses to destroying our egos, and allowing us to create a future we can't yet begin to imagine.
