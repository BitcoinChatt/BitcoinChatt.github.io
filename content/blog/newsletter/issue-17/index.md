<br>

This meetup, dubbed the “Remnant” for those ready to embrace Bitcoin’s deeper truths, offers a chance to explore its potential to fix the many problems caused by the fiat system. Make sure to RSVP, bring your questions, and join us as we dive down the Bitcoin rabbit hole with fellow freedom-lovers. See you there!

### Reminder: No Bitcoin Chatt Meetup on September 20th!

The Bitcoin Chatt meetup, typically held every third Saturday at The Agora Food Club, will not take place on September 20th, since Jason will be attending the <a href="https://bitcoinpark.com/imagineif/index_imagineif.html" target="_blank">Imagine IF Summit</a> in Nashville. We’ll miss our usual gathering at 6112 Hixson Pike, but Jason’s trip will likely bring fresh insights to share with our local Bitcoin community.

Instead, join us on October 4 at the Bitcoin Remnant meetup to celebrate Bitcoin Chatt’s 4th anniversary! As usual for first Saturdays, the birthday party will be at Divine Design Natural Health, 3800 Keith St NW in Cleveland, from 12-2 PM. The next Bitcoin Chatt meetup will then follow on October 18th, also from 12-2 PM, at The Agora. Check [BitcoinChatt.com](https://www.BitcoinChatt.com) for updates as these dates draw nearer.

### BitBit Wallet Enhances Bitcoin Self-Custody

Last Tuesday, the 26th, <a href="https://bitbit.bot/" target="_blank">BitBit</a>, a new self-custodial Lightning wallet, rolled out new features letting you send and receive bitcoin instantly in your desktop's browser, and even get tipped in bitcoin for your tweets. Unlike custodial wallet apps, BitBit ensures that you alone control your private key, keeping your sats secure. This update makes self-custody simple for daily use, opening the door for a bitcoin standard without needing to trust any third parties.

<a href="https://bitbit.bot/" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="BitBit Wallet.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

This upgrade embodies Bitcoin’s ethos of individual sovereignty, offering a robust self-custodial setup, as well as private, off-chain transactions. Long-time Bitcoiners will love sending sats on X for really great tweets, and this will help new bitcoin users to easily master holding their own keys. Visit <a href="https://bitbit.bot/" target="_blank">BitBit.bot</a> to explore this wallet and add it to your desktop's browser!

**Please note:** this wallet is still very new, so there are sure to be bugs. Don't put any significant amount of bitcoin in it until all the bugs are sorted out.

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

Many newcomers to Bitcoin treat it like a stock, wondering when to “exit” and cash out into dollars or another currency. But **Bitcoin isn’t an investment**—it’s the exit strategy from a collapsing fiat system. With its fixed supply of just under 21 million coins and a network that's controlled by no one and everyone, Bitcoin's purchasing power is designed to gradually increase over time. Unlike fiat, which central banks can print endlessly, Bitcoin’s scarcity makes it a haven for your wealth, not something you need to escape from.

In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTPoRDrtc0s" target="_blank">an interview with Laura Shin</a>, Michael Saylor put it bluntly: *"Do you think a Venezuelan company is going to 'take some money off the table' by selling their their US stocks and their US dollars to buy back into local currencies? In Zimbabwe, do you think they would 'take money off the table'? The point is, if you have the superior asset* **it's going up forever, Laura. Forever."** He’s saying Bitcoin’s value proposition—its unchangeable rules and resistance to debasement—makes it the ultimate long-term store of value. Swapping it for fiat currencies—which history shows always collapse eventually (like Venezuela’s or Zimbabwe’s)—is like jumping from a sturdy ship to a sinking one. Bitcoin’s design ensures it keeps rising in real terms as fiat systems falter.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTPoRDrtc0s" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="It's Going Up Forever, Laura.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

The key is to start seeing bitcoin as your everyday money, not a speculative bet. When you hold bitcoin, you’re opting out of a system where money printers erode your savings, governments and banks monitor and censor your transactions, and you need to ask their permission to access the fruits of your own labor. You don’t need an exit strategy from Bitcoin because Bitcoin ***IS*** the exit strategy from that corrupt and broken system!

This paradigm shift takes time, but it’s liberating. By holding Bitcoin, you’re not waiting for the “right time” to sell; you’re just steadily building wealth that will last generations, using a money that’s engineered to outlast the system it's replacing. So keep learning, keep stacking sats, and watch as Bitcoin becomes the new foundation for a sounder financial future.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

Lately I’ve been reflecting a lot on what it means to truly be free, and Bitcoin keeps coming up as the key we all need—not merely for our financial problems, but for something much deeper. The problem with the fiat system isn’t just that dollars are losing value; it’s that it quietly twists the way we think, plan, and live. It rewards short-term thinking, punishes long-term saving, and keeps us tethered to institutions that don’t have our best interests at heart.

Bitcoin, though, is the exit hatch—a way to step out of the fiat system's mess and into a system where the rules are clear, the math is verifiable, and your wealth is truly yours. Every time I get the opportunity to help someone understand this, it feels like I'm chipping away at a wall that’s been keeping humanity from reaching its full potential.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Chipping Away at Ice Wall.gif" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

It's important to realize that Bitcoin isn’t just some tech fad—it’s a tool to reclaim our time and energy. Think about it: every dollar you hold loses value while you sleep, but every sat you stack holds its ground, backed by proof of work and a network that doesn’t bend to anyone’s agenda. That’s not just empowering; it rewires our brains to prioritize long-term goals over instant gratification. It’s a shift that starts small, often by just getting into Bitcoin for its "Number Go Up Technology", but it grows into something life-changing.

So let’s keep at it. Let’s keep talking about Bitcoin, keep stacking sats, and keep showing others the way out. The fiat system may have its claws in deep, but Bitcoin is our tool to pry them loose—not with anger or violence, but with hope and action. We’re not just escaping a broken system; we’re creating a better one. I’ll see you next week at the Bitcoin Remnant meetup, ready to take another step toward that brighter, orange future before us.
