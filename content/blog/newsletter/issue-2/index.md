Hello again!
-------------

Has it been a whole week already? Time sure does fly!

We left an easter egg for some **free sats** (small pieces of bitcoin) in our last email, but it can¬†**only**¬†be claimed by **one**¬†reader, and it hasn't been claimed yet! Look for it in every issue (including somewhere in this one... üòè).

Closing Thoughts
----------------

Whether you plan on enjoying a steakburger, eating a slice of pizza, or just stacking more sats against an uncertain future (and custodying them with your own private key, of course), there's so much going on in Bitcoin, both locally and globally. It may not feel like it, but these are still the early days of Bitcoin, and only the first few rays of its orange sunrise are beginning to gleam on the horizon. This is the beginning of a new era defined by the adoption of sound money, as more nations, businesses, and individuals use it every day. The best time to [learn about it](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/new-to-bitcoin/) was in 2009, but the second best time is right now.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Bitcoin Sunrise.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

Bitcoin is a revolution, but unlike many other revolutions, Bitcoin is peaceful. Rather than destroying the old system, it offers a new system built on verifiable truth, real-world work, and borderless value communication through time and space. Any of us can opt into it whenever we're ready, and in so doing become part of this historical movement to make tomorrow better than yesterday.

I hope to see you at [today's meetup](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/calendar/), but if you can't be there, then I'll catch you in next week's newsletter.

Until next week,

Jason
