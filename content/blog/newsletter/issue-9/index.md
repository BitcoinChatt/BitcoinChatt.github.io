### Reminder: NO BITCOIN REMNANT MEETUP TODAY!

Normally, the Bitcoin Remnant Meetup would gather at Divine Design Natural Health today (since it's the first Saturday of the month) from 12-2pm. But with yesterday's holiday, and Dr. Spradlin being away for now, today's meetup needs to be skipped.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="DDNH Bitcoin Remnant.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

The Bitcoin Remnant meetup will gather again on August 2nd at its usual place and time (see the Upcoming Events below for details, or our [Calendar](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/calendar/)). And the Bitcoin Chatt meetup is still scheduled for 2 weeks from today, on the 19th of this month, from 2-4pm, at the Agora Food Club. We hope to see you there!

### Bitcoin Workshops are Coming to the Chattery!

Starting **August 11th** from **6-8pm**, and continuing monthly on **every 2nd Monday**, the Chattery will host <a href="https://thechattery.org/classes/introduction-to-bitcoin" target="_blank">"Intro to Bitcoin"</a> workshops, led by Bitcoin Chatt's founder, Jason Sellers. If you're unfamiliar with the Chattery, their website states it's a *"nonprofit organization dedicated to cultivating an expansive community of learners and teachers through fun, affordable, and accessible learning and art experiences for adults."* They are located at **231 Broad Street** in downtown Chattanooga.

<a href="[URL here]" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Intro to Bitcoin.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

Admission for each workshop will be $21, and a maximum of 20 students can sign up for each class. If you've been using bitcoin for some time, you're welcome to attend, but these workshops will be tailored to those who are new to Bitcoin, so you may not get much out of it, and you could potentially keep a new user from being able to attend, as well. In any case, we'll love to see you there!

### Senator Cynthia Lummis Proposes Easing Taxes for Small Bitcoin Transactions

Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) has introduced a <a href="https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-unveils-digital-asset-tax-legislation/" target="_blank">new bill</a> intended to modernize and simplify the government's tax treatment of Bitcoin. Under the current rules, any transfer of Bitcoin, no matter how small, is considered a sale, and is therefore subject to capital gains taxation. That means tracking prices, saving receipts, and paying through the nose simply for spending some bitcoin on coffee! A key feature of her bill is the "de minimis" exemption, which would mean gains or losses of less than $300 per transaction, with an annual cap of $5,000, would be exempt from taxation.

<br>

If this bill passes under the current form, small, everyday transactions like getting lunch at Steak 'n Shake would not have to be reported to the IRS. While not perfect, this is certainly a positive step, and more broadly speaking, shows the spreading influence of bitcoin at all levels of society. For individuals, it removes a major hurdle trying to live on a "bitcoin standard." For business owners, it means now is as good a time as any to finally accept bitcoin.

### Ledn Goes All-In on Bitcoin, Drops Ethereum Support

As of July 1, 2025, <a href="https://www.ledn.io/" target="_blank">Ledn, formerly a crypto lending platform, has officially shifted to a **bitcoin-only** operation, discontinuing support for Ethereum (ETH) and its Growth Accounts for both BTC and ETH. This strategic move sharpens Ledn’s focus on its core mission to deliver secure, transparent bitcoin-backed loans, embracing the unmatched simplicity and resilience of Bitcoin’s design. By removing ETH and yield-generating products, Ledn prioritizes client security, ensuring bitcoin collateral remains fully custodied and never rehypothecated for third-party lending.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Ledn Bitcoin Only.jpeg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

This decision aligns with Ledn’s observation that bitcoin dominates over 99% of its $9.9 billion loan book, reflecting strong demand for bitcoin-focused services. The streamlined approach strengthens Ledn’s commitment to offering fast, secure loans with competitive rates—now as low as 12.4% APR—empowering users to leverage their bitcoin without selling it. Visit ledn.io to explore how this bitcoin-only focus can simplify and secure your financial future.

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

Here's the simplest way to understand Bitcoin: All money, of every kind, is merely a ledger, and Bitcoin is no exception. But Bitcoin's ledger is copied and shared by voluntary participants around the world, and it's updated approximately every 10 minutes as everyone comes together to add another page of transactions to it. In fact, that's all the "blockchain" is: a shared ledger that's updated regularly.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Bitcoin Nodes.jpeg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

You've probably heard of "blockchain technology", and been told it's a revolutionary new development, right? But the truth is, a blockchain is anything but revolutionary. In fact, it's merely a digital reinvention of the oldest record that archeologists have ever discovered: a ledger of tally marks etched into stone. And when a blockchain controlled by a central authority (as it is with all cryptos outside of Bitcoin, and many businesses that are experimenting with "blockchain technology", any potential benefits evaporate, and they would have been better-off just using a database instead.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Sumerian Ledger.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

Because there are so many independent copies of Bitcoin's ledger, scattered around the world, it's impossible for any individual, corporation, or nation to destroy it, hack it, or corrupt it in any way. Any seemingly successful attempt to do so would be automatically corrected when the next block (or the next "page" of the ledger) is added and the whole system is audited.

That's the simplest way to understand Bitcoin: it's just a ledger, with copies of it held, maintained, and audited by its users, so it stays verifiably honest. Everything else about Bitcoin—from proof of work mining, to soft forks and hard forks, to cryptographic signatures—are extra details that you can learn more about later. Just remember that far from being imaginary Bitcoin is a record made of perfect honesty, that can only be added to when real-world work has been completed.

Want to learn more about Bitcoin, but are unsure where to begin? You can always complete our [New to Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/new-to-bitcoin) course, but if you're looking for something different, here's our suggested educational resource for this week:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y37wn-f5hmE" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="What is Money.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

In this video, expert wordsmith Adam Livingston takes you on a deep-dive into what money truly is at its core, what Bitcoin is, and how it runs inseparably and harmoniously with nature. Lies can only last for so long, and a society built on dishonest money like dollars will soon crumble. That's what we need Bitcoin: the only pure money unavoidably built on absolute truth.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

I hope you all had a wonderful Independence Day! As we celebrated 249 years since the signing of the Declaration of Independence, I was reminded of the natural cycles our culture goes through. There are small cycles, almost 30 years long, of financial crises, somewhat larger cycles of roughly 85-90 years, of more visible populist movements, and much larger cycle of approximately 250 years each, of major revolutions. As the United States nears its 250th birthday, it's worth taking a moment to review the changes that were happening 250 years ago, compare them to the changes that are happening now, and then commit to ensuring this current revolutionary change will be a significant change for the better.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="3 Harbingers of Revolution.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

You may have heard of the "Four Turnings", which primarily applies to the 85-90-year Populist Movement cycle. The concept rests on the idea that since most people tend to die within that timeframe, and usually about 4 generations are born in that amount of time, cultures tend to repeat this cycle every 85-90 years:

<img class="mobile-banner" src="The Cycle Continues.gif" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

We are living during a time that is often referred to as a Fourth Turning, or when hard times have been created by the weak, but they also strengthen the rising generation, so we can create good times in the future. The last time our culture was in a Fourth Turning, the Great Depression was in full swing, and World War 2 was beginning. The time before that, we were entering the Civil War. And the time before that, Thomas Jefferson was writing the words, "We hold these truths to be self-evident...".

We're living through a time of monumental change, as all 3 of the cycles listed above (as well as an even larger, ~500-year cycle of our culture's overall consciousness, which marked the height of the Renaissance last time we were at this point of the cycle) are converging on today. Rather than feel scared by this, we should be extremely excited! We have every reason to be optimistic about the future, especially when we're the ones who get to build it! The myriad of problems we face today—like war, poverty, crumbling family ties, lower quality of all goods and services, increased nihilism, and all other second- and third-order effects of printing money out of thin air—are typical of a society undergoing intense change. But once the change is complete, the future will look much brighter—and in this cycle's case, it'll look oranger, too!

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Here Comes Bitcoin.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

It's no secret that the United States brought unprecedented prosperity to the world during the height of its power, but it's also no secret that it has been in decline for quite some time. A new paradigm is emerging, though, one based on *rules* instead of *rulers*, on incentives rather than force. And who knows: perhaps Bitcoin's never-before-seen incentive structure will finally break humanity's 250-year cycle, and unlike everything else before it, never start to decline after roughly 125 years (which will actually be pretty close to when the last satoshi will be mined). But that's for our great-great-great-great grandchildren to experience and take care of; until then, we have a lot of upward momentum to look forward to, and I'm not just talking about Bitcoin's price.
