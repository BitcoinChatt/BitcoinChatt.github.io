### Bitcoin Chatt at the Caps, Gowns & Crowns Fest

Earlier this week, BitcoinÂ Chattanooga's Founder, Jason Sellers, met with the organizer of theÂ [Caps, Gowns & Crowns Fest](https://www.facebook.com/events/2577132402456951), a free, family-friendly outdoor festival celebrating the graduates and promotions of 2025. Jason was invited to set up aÂ booth forÂ Bitcoin ChattanoogaÂ at the event, where he will sell Bitcoin books, give away some free bitcoin, and orange-pill those who drop by the booth (as well as the nearby vendors ðŸ˜‰).

<br>

Please drop by today between 10am and 5pm (sooner might be better, since we might get rained out and will have to close down early) to take part inÂ all the activities there, and support BitcoinÂ Chattanooga!

### Michael Saylor on Using Bitcoin to Qualify for Mortgages

On Monday, the 23rd, Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director, Bill Pulte, [tweeted](https://x.com/pulte/status/1937303023518445931): "We will study the usage pf cryptocurrency holdings as it relates to qualifying for mortgages." To which Executive Chairman of Strategyâ‚¿, Michael Saylor, replied with the following:

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Saylor FHFA News.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

Saylor's model helps assess the risk of using Bitcoin as collateral for loans by considering factors like loan length, Bitcoin price, and volatility. Using it would make it easier for people to get mortgages using their bitcoin, without having to sell it back into dollars. And since this exchange on X, the FHFA has orderedÂ Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to recognize Bitcoin as a mortgage asset, with no USD conversion needed. This is a *huge* step forward in legitimizing bitcoin and allowing its hodlers to use it the way it was always meant to be used: as *money*.

### BTC Sessions YouTube Channel Temporarily Shut Down

On Thursday, the 26th,Â [BTC Sessions](https://www.youtube.com/@BTCSessions), one of the most popular Bitcoin channels on YouTube, was shut down and all its videos removedÂ during a livestream without warning. BTC Sessions is known for having some of the best Bitcoin educational content on YouTube, including tutorials that are helpful for new and long-time users alike (which is why we have so many of them listed on our [educational resources](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/new-to-bitcoin/resources/) page). So when YouTube tookÂ the channel down forÂ "severe or repeated violations of [their] harmful and dangerous policy", thousands of the channel'sÂ followersÂ took to social media, tagged YouTube and demanded that they reinstateÂ BTC Sessions. Several hours later, YouTube took notice and restored the channel, but this is a prime example of a much larger problem.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/tq1iLRndi5w" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="BTC Sessions.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

Censorship has been a problem that major internet platforms like YouTube have had difficulty managing for many years. And while alternatives like [Rumble](https://rumble.com/) exist, they are still centralized platforms that *could* censor their users if they wanted to, so at bestÂ they're only temporary solutions. A much better and permanent option would be to use a decentralized *protocol* (not a platform) like [Nostr](https://nostr.how/en/what-is-nostr), but at the present time, the tools don't yet exist for hosting the sheerÂ number of BTC Sessions' videos, at the length they usually are, to say nothing of everyone else's. So while BTC Sessions will be focusing more on its [Rumble](https://rumble.com/c/BTCsessions) page, it has also sounded the alarm on the need for a scalable and decentralized solution to such frequent violations of our freedom of speech.

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

Bitcoiners like to point out that "Bitcoin fixes this" when discussing many of the world's problems. But some of the negatives that Bitcoin fixes aren't as obvious as others. This is because fiat money (or money that is printed from nothingÂ and controlled by *fiat*, which is Latin for *by decree*)Â has second- and third-order effects that most people don't connect to money printing. And Bitcoin likewise has second- and third-order effects that counter those of the money printer, but many fail to see them.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Effects of Fiat Money.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

Even one of the most easily seen effects of fiat moneyâ€”rising prices of goods and servicesâ€”is sometimes attributed to other causes, such asÂ greedy corporations. While that is definitely a factor, the *root cause* of price increases is simply a higher supply of money in the economy, which is distributed unevenly across the nation and the world, starting with the central bank, the Federal Reserve (which is not actually federal and holds no reserves). The same money you have to *work* for, they print out of thin air, and use to fund endless wars and other projects that the government wants to spend it on.

It may seem like a stretch to say that fiat money is the root cause behind the disintegration of families and the destruction of society, but as one connects the dots, it can't be unseen. When the cost of livingÂ rises 20% but paychecks only rise 2% (and especially when the government and media distract us from the real cause), people respond in the best ways they know how:Â they buy things now instead of saving and buying it whenÂ prices areÂ higher; they buy "food" that's terrible for them because it's cheaper, and businesses have to make the terrible foodÂ to cut costs and stay in business; both parents have to work just to *barely* get by, and they're having fewer children, which becomes unsustainable as generations go by. All this creates a fragile social structure held together by distrust and desperation, and inevitably leads to a breakdown of any kind of peaceful coexistence. This decline has been happening in earnest since 1971, and you can see more examples of itÂ by going to [WTFHappenedIn1971.com](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/).

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gS05vIvAW9I" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="When Money is Easy to Make.gif" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

Fortunately, Bitcoin turns all of this around. When you use bitcoin as your money, your cost of living goes down over time. This encourages people to save more and only buy what they need and when they need it. It also allows businesses to improve the quality of their productsâ€”food or otherwiseâ€”which they'll want to do in order to earn more bitcoin from their customers. As the cost of living falls, parents can afford to have more children, mothers can stay home to raiseÂ them, and fathers won't have to work as many hours to support them. On a Bitcoin standard, wars become unaffordable for all nations that would engage in them, and negotiations become much more profitable. All this creates a positive feedback loop of greater peace, prosperity, and social cohesion. It won't be a "utopia", since there will always be new social challenges to face, but society will be better-off than it has ever been before.

Why is this not a reality yet? Because of the fiat money printer, and because Bitcoin adoption is still so small (only about 3%, according to [some estimates](https://river.com/learn/files/river-bitcoin-adoption-report-2025.pdf)). But as more people are made aware of how our monetary system currently works, its second- and third-order effects, and what we could have instead, we can move this peaceful revolution forward, and build a better world for our children and grandchildren.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

If you've read through this whole email, then you've seen several examples of what Bitcoin is all about, and definitely one thing that it's *not* so muchÂ about (though the thing itself isn't bad). The purpose of Bitcoin is to fix this broken world we live in; to allow parents to spend time with and pass along wisdom to the rising generation; to break through censorship, whether financial or informational; to revolt peacefully against destructive forces; to be a moral and ethical form of money, and serve as a foundation for a moral and ethical society. Sure, you will also be able to use bitcoin to purchase a home, and that's great, but it's important to never lose sight of the fact thatÂ Bitcoin was really created to help you lower your time preference.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Time Preference Spectrum.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

Unfortunately,Â when most peopleÂ learn about Bitcoin, this usually isn't what they're prepared to hear. Most people get into it because they see its price rise, and want to use it to get wealthier in terms ofÂ dollars. And there's nothing wrong with that; we're all trying to take care of ourselves and our loved ones in any way we know how. But some people get stuck there, confusing the means for the ends, andÂ chasing the next shiny thing, which often means scammy cryptocurrencies. And then, after the rug gets pulled out from under them, they reasonablyÂ want nothing more to do with crypto or anything related to it (and they mistakenly include BitcoinÂ with it). This slows down the adoption ofÂ Bitcoin's benefits a little more,Â both on an individualÂ level and for the world in general.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Take the Orange Pill.jpeg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

That's why Bitcoin is so often referred to as a "rabbit hole". We even use the term "orange pill" as a direct reference to *The Matrix*, when someone leaves the fiat world for the Wonderland of Bitcoin, and we show them how deep the rabbit hole goes (spoiler alert:Â no one has yet found the bottom of the Bitcoin rabbit hole). We may start with only being interested in Bitcoin's "Number Go Up" price action, but if we keep learning, keep discussing Bitcoin and related topics with others, and keep adjusting our lives to live more in line withÂ the Bitcoin ethos of truth, humility, verifiability, and other good qualities, then we can experience more of what this fascinating new technology can offer us.
