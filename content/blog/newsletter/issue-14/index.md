### Intro to Bitcoin at the Chattery

This Monday, the 11th, from 6-8pm, Bitcoin Chatt founder Jason Sellers will host a workshop all about Bitcoin at the Chattery in downtown Chattanooga. Attendees will find out why Bitcoin is needed, how it works, and how to use it, and will leave with a small amount of free bitcoin they can keep, as they start on their own sat-stacking journey.

### Bitcoin Chatt: Field Trip to a Bitcoin Mine!

Join us in 1 week for a very special Bitcoin Chatt event, as we go on a field trip and take a tour through a Bitcoin mining facility right here in Chattanooga! Get ready to have all your questions answered and learn all about Bitcoin mining.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Chattanooga ASICs.jpeg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

Here's the plan: Instead of meeting at the Agora, we'll meet at the [Brickyard](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jfmZQwBgBXodPd5h6), which is a VC business that's run by a Bitcoiner who is happy to accommodate us. We'll do this because the driving time from the Agora to the mining facility is about 30 minutes each way, while the driving time from the Brickyard is only about 5-10 minutes. You should be the Brickyard at noon, and once we're sure everyone has arrived, we'll carpool to the mining facility, and then carpool back to the Brickyard for the rest of the meetup, which will run until 2pm.

Your family and friends are welcome to join us, but remember that Bitcoin miners are *loud*, so small children (anyone who's not yet an adolescent) should not be part of the tour.

### Trump Signs Executive Order for Bitcoin to be Used in 401(k)s

On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14110, which allows Bitcoin to be included in 401(k) retirement plans. Since most Americans use 401(k)s to prepare for retirement, this could completely change how they save for the future. The order directs the U.S. Department of Labor to review and update fiduciary guidelines, which would make it possible for individuals to allocate a portion of their retirement savings to bitcoin.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Trump Bitcoin 401k.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

This change brings Bitcoin into the mainstream financial system, where it can be used alongside traditional investments like stocks and bonds. If you're new to Bitcoin, think of it as another tool for escaping inflation and monetary debasement—one that has out-performed every other asset for 15 years straight. Bottom line: this change will make it easier for more people to include bitcoin in their long-term financial plans.

### The “Imagine IF” Summit in Nashville: A Gathering for Innovation and Freedom

On September 19th and 20th, Bitcoin Park will be hosting the “Imagine IF” summit in Nashville, a two-day event dedicated to exploring the intersection of technology, human rights, and economic freedom. This summit will bring together 125 global leaders, including human rights activists, software developers, social entrepreneurs, privacy advocates, educators, community builders, and designers from over 60 countries. The agenda covers critical topics like Bitcoin’s role in financial sovereignty, the impact of AI on society, and strategies for advancing human rights through technology. For Bitcoiners, this is a prime opportunity to dive deep into how Bitcoin empowers individuals to escape financial repression and censorship.

<br>

The summit also addresses broader themes such as AI’s potential to enhance or threaten privacy, the future of work in a digital economy, and innovative approaches to community building. Workshops and discussions will explore how these technologies can be harnessed to create a better world, with a special focus on Bitcoin’s unique ability to offer financial autonomy without intermediaries. Whether you’re new to Bitcoin or a long-time hodler, the “Imagine IF” summit offers a platform to learn, network, and envision a future where technology serves humanity.

Your Bitcoin Tip

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

In last week's newsletter, we discussed Bitcoin mining, and one part of it said, "If the output starts with a specific number of zeros (currently at least 19 zeros, but this changes occasionally—**more on this next week**), then the miner has found a valid hash." This was referring to a clever mechanism called the Difficulty Adjustment, which keeps the rate of new Bitcoin blocks—and the issuance of newly mined Bitcoin with them—close to its original schedule, even as more miners join the network.

Here’s how it works: Bitcoin’s protocol states that a new block of transactions should be produced every 10 minutes, on average. Miners compete to find a valid hash, and the more zeros required at the beginning of the hash, the harder it is to find a valid one. Think of it like miners are throwing darts while blindfolded, and the target automatically moves away a little if they hit it too often, and closer if they don't hit it often enough. This adjustment happens every 2016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks. In fact, the most recent one happened just yesterday, at 4:53pm, at block [909216](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000001fa0fbcad4d89e1e2c3c240f09a1e4be5fdb378c4af31).

<a href="https://charts.bitbo.io/mining-difficulty/" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Bitcoin Difficulty.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

You can also think of hashing as rapidly guessing the combination to a safe, by cycling through every possible combination. The first safe should take 10 minutes to unlock, but as more miners join in, the correct combination would be found faster. If, after 2016 "safes" are unlocked, the average time it took to open each of them is less than 10 minutes, then the next set of 2016 safes will have more possible combinations, making the correct one proportionally harder to find. But if the average time it took was more than 10 minutes, then the next 2016 safes will have proportionally fewer combinations to try out.

Compare that with the best type of money humanity ever had before bitcoin: gold. As gold's price rises, more people are incentivized to mine it. As more people mine it, its supply increases. As its supply rises to meet or even exceed market demand, its price stagnates or even drops. Zoom out over a long enough time horizon (thinking in terms of millennia), and gold's purchasing power tends to level out, only rising very gradually (until recent decades, of course).

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Bitcoin and Gold Mining.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

Bitcoin doesn't have this problem. If bitcoin was a physical substance waiting to be dug up like gold, its Difficulty Adjustment would be as if its tiny pieces could burrow deeper, avoiding the increasing number of miners searching for them, until the right time for each piece to be found. This way, greater demand for bitcoin does not lead to a higher supply sooner than what Satoshi originally scheduled. Instead, it only leads to ever-rising purchasing power, both now, while bitcoin is still measured in dollars, and into the future, as prices for everything continue to fall in bitcoin terms, forever.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

Bitcoin has a way of attracting those who tend to be more responsible than most. Or, at least those who are willing and able enough to *become* more responsible. Personal responsibility is the unavoidable other side of the coin with freedom, and is *how* fixing the money fixes the world.

Every new Bitcoin user, who really *gets* it and understands why Bitcoin is such a big deal, gives me a little more hope for mankind. Every child who grows up using it, who is taught personal responsibility from a young age, makes me more bullish for the future. Yes, there are likely *billions* who have heard of Bitcoin but aren't interested in using it as their money, whether because thy believe some FUD or because they're just more interested in last night's game. Regardless, every day they choose to not opt-out of slavery and opt-in to freedom and responsibility, they make themselves and their descendants a little less relevant to humanity's future.

<br>

What Michael Saylor said is true: Getting into Bitcoin is on a "need-to-know" basis. If your friend, family member, neighbor, coworker, or anyone else doesn't want to see the value in Bitcoin, don't force them. They'll either come around eventually and starting buying bitcoin at the price they deserve, or they'll persist in their irrelevancy. Author and entrepreneur Aleks Svetski put it succinctly: ["Bitcoiners are the remnant, the masses don't matter."](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoiners-are-the-remnant)

We don't need the masses to change before the world changes. Much of the world immediately surrounding us changes for the better as soon as *we* change for the better, so it only takes a small handful of us on a global scale to start turning things around for everyone. We're already seeing that as Bitcoin-friendly people are appointed to positions in the government and Federal Reserve, and are even searching for absolute truth and [finding God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqbKB47xbmA).

<br>

Little by little, *very* gradually and then very suddenly, we're turning this world around, financially, culturally, and spiritually. And this makes me *incredibly* optimistic for the world my children and grandchildren will inherit from me.

If you don't feel bullish for the future yet, keep watching. There is still ***so much*** for Bitcoiners to look forward to, and we're just getting started.
