### Join Us for BitcoinÂ Chatt!

We're meeting later today at The Agora Food Club, at <a href="[URL here]" target="_blank">6112 Hixson Pike</a> in Hixson, from 2-4pm, and we would love to see you there! **Remember to go to the building in the back;** just look for our banner with the Bitcoin Chatt logo on it, and we'll be sitting at the tables inside the building.

<br>

As with all BitcoinÂ Chatt meetups, we'll "chatt" freely about Bitcoin and related topics, and get to know each other. But one topic that we'll definitely need to discuss today is whether Bitcoin Chatt should remain a nonprofit, or change to a different structure. It's not officially recognized by the IRS asÂ a 501(c)(3) yet (part of the hold-up is not only the cost required with acquiring that status, but especially the bureaucracy,Â red tape, and general fiat-ness associated with that status), but it is registered as a nonprofit with the state of Tennessee. So we'll talk about whether we should change that, and if so, what kind of structureÂ we should change it to.

If you're new to Bitcoin and looking for in-person help with getting started, theÂ members there will be happyÂ assist you and answer all your questions!

### New All-Time High...Again!

Early in the morning on the 14th, Bitcoin's price reached a new all-time high of a little over $123,000! Bitcoin is perfectly scarce, and unlocking more of it (commonly known as "mining" it) gets harder all the time, so as demand for it rises, its price rises, as well.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Bitcoin All Time High Again.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

Remember, though, that each bitcoin can be divided into 100 million pieces, called "satoshis" or "sats", after Bitcoin's mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Just as every dollar has 100 pennies/cents,Â everyÂ bitcoin has 100 *million* satoshis/sats.Â So instead of saying "Zero point zero zero zero zero one bitcoin" (that's a lot of "zero"s!), you can simply say "one-thousand sats", because it's the exact same thing. So even if you only have $1 to exchange for bitcoin, you can still get 846 sats for it, at least at the time thatÂ this newsletter is being written.

### GENIUS Act Signed into Law

Yesterday, July 18th, President Trump signed the **G**uiding and **E**stablishing **N**ational **I**nnovation for **U**.S. **S**tablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law, marking a historic milestone for Bitcoin's acceptance in the minds of the masses. The legislation establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins, while encouraging broader institutional and retail participation in all kinds of digital assets.

<br>

Stablecoins often serve as on-ramps to Bitcoin, so the passage of the GENIUS Act is a sign of growing confidence in Bitcoinâ€™s role in our economy. For those looking to live on a Bitcoin standard, the clarity provided by this bill removes many barriers to using bitcoin for everyday transactions, like buying groceries or paying bills. And hopefully, this bill will take us one step closer to eliminating capital gains taxes on Bitcoin transactions entirely!

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

Last week, we discussed the Liquid Network, a "sidechain" that works in conjunction with Bitcoin main blockchain, and allows for cheaper, faster, and more private bitcoin payments. Today, we'll dive into the Lightning Network, how it works, and why you should be using it.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Hasta la vista Visa.gif" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

The Lightning Network doesn't use a blockchain like Liquid or Bitcoin's base layer. Instead, it's made of a network of users who have opened "channels" with each other, with each channel containing some bitcoin. This bitcoin never leaves the channel (unless the channel is closed), but moves from one user's side of the channel to the other, like beads on an abacus, allowing for instant, private, and free or nearly free transactions.

How does it work? Suppose Alice wants to open a Lightning channel with Bob, and puts 0.5 bitcoin in it. She would first need the necessary information aboutÂ Bob's node (a computer running Bitcoin's protocol), and then she would broadcast a regular transaction to Bitcoin's blockchain, locking her 0.5 bitcoin in a Lightning channel. Once that transaction is confirmed, she can send up to 0.5 bitcoin to Bob instantly, privately, and for free, but he would only be able to send back what she previously sent to him. They could send the bitcoin back and forth between each other, as many times as they want,Â andÂ if they ever want to close the channel, either of them could do so byÂ broadcasting a new transaction to Bitcoin's blockchain, showing the new state of who owns the 0.5 bitcoin. If, after the channel is closed, Alice has 0.4 bitcoin and Bob has 0.1, that's what's posted to Bitcoin's ledger, and all that anyone else would ever see. Alice and Bob could have transacted back and forth thousands of times, but only they would have any record ofÂ those transactions.

But let's say Alice wants to send some bitcoin to Frank, who has no direct connection with her. This is where the network part of the Lightning Network comes in.Â Alice has an openÂ channel with Carol, who has a channel with Ella, who has a channel with Frank, so Alice can send a payment to Frank, usingÂ Carol and Ella as "hops" in between. Carol or Ella may charge a small fee to route Alice's payment to Frank, but neither of them would be able to tell whether the payment started with Alice or ended with Frank, so Alice and Frank's privacy is still preserved.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Lightning Network.gif" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

Today, the Lightning Network is huge, and payments almost never fail, and are usually pretty cheap. There are many exchanges and custodial wallets (apps that hold your bitcoin, but you're trusting someone else to keep it safe)Â that use the Lightning Network, like <a href="https://strike.me/referral/?code=IEU8IW" target="_blank">Strike</a>, <a href="https://cash.app/app/ZBHJXGR" target="_blank">Cash App</a>, <a href="https://coinos.io/" target="_blank">CoinOS</a>, and <a href="https://primal.net/home" target="_blank">Primal</a>. But there are also many noncustodial wallets (apps that hold your bitcoin, but you have full responsibility for your bitcoin, and don't have to trust anyone to keep it safe for you)Â that use the Lightning Network, like <a href="https://mannabitcoin.com/" target="_blank">Manna</a>, <a href="https://phoenix.acinq.co/" target="_blank">Phoenix</a>, and <a href="https://www.muun.com/" target="_blank">Muun</a>. If you're new to Bitcoin, follow each of those links to look into each one, and choose the one that fits you best.

Start receiving payments over Lightning by creating a Lightning Invoice inside a Lightning wallet app. TheseÂ require you to be present for the payment,Â to set the amount you wish to receive, and they expire after a time limit is reached. Another method to receive bitcoin over LightningÂ is toÂ use a Lightning Address, which is, as previously explainedÂ in this email, like an email address, but used for receiving bitcoin over the Lightning Network. Most Lightning wallets provide you with a Lightning Address, so once you have one, paste it on social media and elsewhere online, so you can receive a tip of any amount, from anyone, and at any time.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

IÂ meet new people every day and talk with them about Bitcoin and what we're doing at BitcoinÂ Chatt. Just yesterday, I spoke with many people at the <a href="https://csthea2025.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Chattanooga Southeast Tennessee Home Education Association</a> (many of whom signed up for this newsletterâ€”hello! ðŸ‘‹), and IÂ was fascinated by the factÂ that Bitcoiners have a culture that's all their own. We wear hats, shirts, and other swag that often don't have a company logo on them, but they do carryÂ a Bitcoin logo, which is not owned by any company. We do this to promote Bitcoin, of course, but it's not for Bitcoin's sake, or for those of usÂ who "got in early" (side note: if you're reading this, and Bitcoin's price is anywhere below $60 million, you're also getting in early...but IÂ digress), but for the sake of those around us, who are not yet familiar with this new form of money.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Randomly Start Talking About Bitcoin.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

Deep in their core, Bitcoiners are driven by an insatiableÂ desire toÂ make the world a better place, and believe that changing from a broken money system (dollars) to a functional money system (bitcoin)Â is the best way to accomplish that. But they can't fix the world from a macro, world-sized perspective. Instead, BitcoinersÂ have to focus on helping individuals, andÂ seeking toÂ meet theirÂ needs at *their* level. Bitcoiners understand the implications of having a decentralized, scarce, digital money, and they want those around them to understand those implications, as well.

This is one reason why I personally take so much issue with peopleÂ conflating BitcoinersÂ with general crypto enthusiasts, who often care more about pumping their own bags than fixing the world, and frequently stoop to outright scams to get what they want. Such peopleÂ could not be more different from Bitcoiners.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Less Dollars.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

But here's the thing that neither "crypto bros" nor those outside the Bitcoin space understand: *Bitcoin is not meant to give you more dollars, and if it does, you're using it wrong.* Just as the lifeboats weren't meant to give passengers a better suite on the Titanic, and the red pill wasn't meant to give Neo a better job inÂ the Matrix, Bitcoinâ€”the "orange pill", and a true lifeboat for escapingÂ inflation, censorship, and asset forfeitureâ€”wasn't made to make anyone rich. It was made to make everyone *free*.

"You are a slave, Neo," Morpheus said in that memorable scene in *The Matrix*. "Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind." We have all been born into bondage, and Bitcoin is only the *beginning* of the way out. It's not just our wallets that are slaves to inflation, but our minds are slaves to indoctrination, our bodies are slaves to a lack ofÂ nutrition, and even our very souls can beÂ slaves to counterfeit religion.Â But money touches everything, especially our incentives and the way we see the world, so when a society's money changes from inflationary to scarce,Â from dishonest to honest, and from obeying the flimsy decrees of man to following the immutableÂ laws of God, everything turns around for the better, and humanity discovers true freedom in every way, for the first time.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Platos Bitcoin Cave.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

This is why we Bitcoin. This is why we wear our silly shirts and hats with Bitcoin logos on them:Â to show those around us that no matter how dark the world gets, there's an orangeÂ light at the end of the tunnel, and we're eagerÂ toÂ show them how to reach it.

See you at the meetup.
