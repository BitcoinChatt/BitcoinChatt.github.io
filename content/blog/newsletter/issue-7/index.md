### 16 *Billion* Account Credentials Leaked

A massive data breach, reported on Thursday, the 19th, has exposed over 16 billion login credentials, making it the largest password leak in history. The leaked datasets include usernames, emails, passwords, and sensitive metadata from platforms like Apple, Google, Facebook, Telegram, Instagram, Microsoft, Netflix, PayPal, Roblox, Discord, and GitHub, as well as government services from 29 countries (including the US and UK). This unprecedented exposure heightens risks of phishing attempts, account takeovers, and identity theft. It's important that you change your passwords as soon as you can, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), and use tools like <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank">Have I Been Pwned</a> to check if your accounts have been compromised.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Passwords Breach.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

This breach should serve as a reminder to never store your private keys in cloud service, or anywhere online, since there will always be a non-zero chance that sensitive data will eventually be leaked like this. Instead, secure your keys offline on paper—or better yet, on steel or titanium—and keep them somewhere safe from any potential threat of theft. And while most self-custodial hot wallets (wallet apps on your phone or another device that's connected to the internet) keep your bitcoin pretty safe by encrypting your private keys and keeping them on your device, the best security comes from generating private keys offline from a hardware wallet, and using a multisig setup, so no single key can be used to access your bitcoin.

Some great hardware wallet options are the <a href="https://blockstream.com/jade/" target="_blank">Blockstream Jade</a>, the <a href="https://seedsigner.com/" target="_blank">Seed Signer</a>, and the <a href="https://coldcard.com/" target="_blank">Cold Card</a>, and some of the best tools for managing a multisig setup are <a href="https://bluewallet.io/" target="_blank">BlueWallet</a>, <a href="https://nunchuk.io/" target="_blank">Nunchuk</a>, and <a href="https://bitcoinkeeper.app/" target="_blank">Bitcoin Keeper</a>.

### US Debt Clock Passes $37 *Trillion!*

Also on Thursday, the 19th, the <a href="https://www.usdebtclock.org/" target="_blank">US Debt Clock</a>—a fantastic website that shows a glimpse of how much financial trouble the United States is in—showed that the US National Debt passed $37 trillion! This isn't exactly the kind of "Number Go Up" that most Bitcoiners were hoping for, but as economist <a href="https://x.com/LynAldenContact" target="_blank">Lyn Alden</a> has often pointed out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Giuzcd4oxIk" target="_blank">"Nothing stops this train."</a> And this isn't even counting the government's unfunded liabilities, which would make this number many trillions of dollars higher!

<a href="https://www.usdebtclock.org/" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="US National Debt.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

Why does this keep happening, and why can't the government stop it? To put it simply, they have two choices: end this madness and drive the most powerful nation in the world into the ground, or go into further debt and keep up the charade.

When the US government borrows freshly-printed dollars from the Federal Reserve (which is a private bank, not federal, and it has no reserves), the Federal Reserve also has two choices: raise interest rates and send us into a recession or even a depression, or lower interest rates and add to the inflation that's already eroding the livelihoods of millions domestically and billions globally.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Lower Interest Rates.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

No politician or banker wants to be the one who destroys the very system that gives them their power, so the Federal Reserve continues to print and the US government continues to go ever deeper into its black hole of debt.

Bitcoin is our only escape from this nightmare.

Your Bitcoin Tip

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

One of bitcoin's revolutionary qualities is that it's *unconfiscatable.* But is it really? Many people have had their bitcoin stolen by hackers or seized by their government, so why do Bitcoiners say that Bitcoin is unconfiscatable?

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Bitcoin Lock and Key.jpeg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

It all depends on your level of security. If, for example, your bitcoin is being kept on an exchange, then it's easy for a hacker or rogue employee to steal it, or for the government to confiscate it. But then again, if you were trusting a 3rd party to hold it for you, was it really yours to begin with?

If you send your bitcoin from the exchange and into a wallet that gives you the private key (12 or 24 random words), and you have the private key written down and hidden somewhere as a backup, then it's much harder for your bitcoin to ever be stolen, even if it's in a wallet app on a phone connected to the internet. Yes, malware and brute-forcing your passwords could still lead to a loss of funds, but these aren't likely to occur. The only other way your bitcoin could be stolen is if a thief gets physical possession of your private key, so do everything you can to keep that safe, as if it were the bitcoin itself—because for all intents and purpose, it is!

But still, if you want even better security, then it's best to get a hardware wallet, also called a signing device, that can create private keys offline, so they never touch anything that connects to the internet. This eliminates any possibility of theft through hacking, and if the device doesn't even keep the private keys on it. As an example, this is how <a href="https://seedsigner.com/" target="_blank">Seed Signer</a> works, so even if the device is found and stolen, your private keys will still be safe.

<a href="https://xkcd.com/538/" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="5 Dollar Wrench Attack.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

But what about the classic <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/" target="_blank">"$5 Wrench Attack"</a>? The highest form of bitcoin security protects against this, and is called multisig. With a multisig wallet, multiple private keys are needed to sign-off on any transaction, so if the private keys are geographically dispersed and an attacker only finds one of them, they won't be able to steal your bitcoin. Most multisig setups are "2-of-3", meaning the wallet has 3 private keys, and any 2 of them are required for the bitcoin to move. And if even greater security is desired, then 3-of-5s, 5-of-7s, and other setups are possible. This increases the risk of permanently losing the minimum number of private keys, though, so this should only be used if absolutely necessary, and with extreme caution.

In the end, no level of security can ever be perfect, and that shouldn't be the goal, anyway. Security needs to be a deterrent; it should force a would-be thief to do so much work to get your bitcoin, that they'll likely give up long before they find it. But if they do manage to access it, then they've truly earned it. On the other hand, be careful to not force yourself into a scavenger hunt every time you want to move some sats! Find a happy-medium that fits your own situation best.

Recommended Resource
--------------------

Want to learn more about Bitcoin, but are unsure where to begin? You can always complete our [New to Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/new-to-bitcoin) course, but if you're looking for something different, here's our suggested educational resource for this week:

<a href="https://nomoreinflation.com/" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="No More Inflation.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

The film <a href="https://nomoreinflation.com/" target="_blank">No More Inflation</a> dropped earlier this week, and it's a must-see for everyone who is experiencing rising fiat prices. It starts by showing exactly what inflation really is and what causes it, and then goes into its other effects, from poor health to the disintegration of the family. This documentary also provides a simple primer for Bitcoin, so anyone can understand it, and see how it truly does fix the many problems our world is facing today.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

Anyone who knows me will tell you that I'm an idealist. I've repeatedly tested as an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality" target="_blank">INFP</a> on the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test" target="_blank">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</a>, which means (among other things) that when I have a vision for a better future, and I feel called upon to bring it into reality, I become driven, and hardly anything can stop me. The one thing that stops me most often, however, is myself.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="INFP Contradicting Traits.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

Like (almost) everyone else, I make plenty of mistakes. And like many people (but certainly not everyone), I get down on myself harshly for those mistakes, probably way more than I should. My slip-ups and slowness often lead me to wonder and worry about the future for Bitcoin Chattanooga—and especially my family!—as I frequently feel indescribably inadequate for everything that I need to do.

We all have good times and bad, the same way that Bitcoin has bull and bear markets. During the "bull markets" of our lives, it's best to hodl on and enjoy the journey with gratitude in our hearts. But during our lives' "bear markets", that's when it's crucial to remember our fundamentals, and work harder than ever before to position ourselves for our next inevitable bull market.

<a href="https://x.com/BTCMinstrel/status/1591851258188546053" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="BTC Minstrel - Moscow Time - gif.gif" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

That's why I'm such a big fan of the BTC Minstrel, and especially his "Moscow Time" sea shanty. From the first time I heard that song, my mind effortlessly turned it into a metaphor for life (as it often does with many things). For the sake of context, here are the full lyrics:

<br>
<p style="text-align: center">
The price goes up and your spirits soar.<br>
When the fair winds blow.<br>
The price goes down and you're on the floor.<br>
When the bear winds blow.<br>
Friends all asking if it's time to buy.<br>
When the fair winds blow.<br>
Friends all laughing and you want to cry.<br>
When the bear winds blow.<br>
<br>
Fair or foul,<br>
bull or bear,<br>
the blocks will still be mined.<br>
We all keep stacking 'cause we must prepare<br>
for one past midnight Moscow Time.<br>
<br>
Shitcoin scammers filling up your feed.<br>
When the fair winds blow.<br>
They run and hide when their coins all bleed.
When the bear winds blow.<br>
Bitcoin maxis are mean and cruel.<br>
When the fair winds blow.<br>
But those who cried all look like fools.<br>
When the bear winds blow.<br>
<br>
Fair or foul,<br>
bull or bear,<br>
the blocks will still be mined.<br>
We all keep stacking 'cause we must prepare<br>
for one past midnight Moscow Time.<br>
<br>
Margin traders all get respect.<br>
When the fair winds blow.<br>
The tide goes out and they all get rekt.<br>
When the bear winds blow.<br>
Your net worth's soaring up to the sky.<br>
When the fair winds blow.<br>
But you got on zero now you wonder why.<br>
When the bear winds blow.<br>
<br>
Fair or foul,<br>
bull or bear,<br>
the blocks will still be mined.<br>
We all keep stacking 'cause we must prepare<br>
for one past midnight Moscow Time.<br>
<br>
The miners buy 'cause they need the hash.<br>
When the fair winds blow.<br>
The miners sell 'cause the need the cash.<br>
When the bear winds blow.<br>
They come for gains and the cars and the girls.<br>
When the fair winds blow.<br>
Then it's fix the money and fix the world.<br>
When the bear winds blow.<br>
<br>
Fair or foul,<br>
bull or bear,<br>
the blocks will still be mined.<br>
We all keep stacking 'cause we must prepare<br>
for one past midnight Moscow Time.<br>
<br>

From this song, I realized these important truths:

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin keeps getting up after every dip, so why shouldn't we?
<li>Just as Bitcoin adds another block every ~10 minutes, we just need to keep putting one foot in front of the other.
<li>Bitcoin runs on proof of work, so our lives should, too.

Beyond building a Bitcoin circular economy here, my hope is that we will all imbue more of Bitcoin' qualities into our own lives, or at least feel inspired when we consider everything that Bitcoin is. Let's try to remember these things, so we'll be all the more prepared next time we each go through our own "bear market".

I look forward to seeing you at the meetup later today, as well as in next week's email.
