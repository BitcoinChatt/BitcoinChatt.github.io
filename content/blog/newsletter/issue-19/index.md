### Reminder: No Bitcoin Chatt Meetup on September 20th

Our regular Bitcoin Chatt meetup, which gathers every third Saturday at The Agora Food Club at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/KDDEinU8BForfyft8" target="_blank">6112 Hixson Pike</a>, won’t be held on September 20th. Jason will be attending the <a href="https://bitcoinpark.com/imagineif/index_imagineif.html" target="_blank">Imagine IF Summit</a> in Nashville that weekend, so we’re taking a short break from our usual in-person discussions and networking. We’ll miss seeing everyone there, but this will give us a chance to recharge and come back stronger for future events.

Global Bitcoin News

### NPM Developer Account Compromise Leads to Wallet App Vulnerabilities

On September 8th, a prominent developer’s account on the Node Package Manager (NPM) registry was compromised, allowing malicious actors to push updates to a widely used JavaScript library for handling Bitcoin addresses. This led to several mobile wallet apps inadvertently altering users’ sending addresses to closely mimic legitimate ones, but redirecting funds to the attacker's wallet instead. The issue was quickly identified by the Bitcoin community, with affected apps issuing urgent patches, but not before some users reported small losses from test transactions.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="NPM Account Compromised.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

While a total of less than $50's worth of funds were stolen across all affected cryptocurrencies, developers are now auditing their app's dependencies more rigorously, and users are advised to verify addresses manually before sending any bitcoin (which is always a good practice, anyway). While the compromise was swiftly contained and resolved, this serves as another reminder to always think adversarially, and consider using hardware signing devices, like <a href="https://seedsigner.com/" target="_blank">Seed Signer</a> or <a href="https://coldcard.com/" target="_blank">Cold Card</a>, for added security when managing your bitcoin.

### US Regulators Propose Rules Flagging Bitcoin Self-Custody as Suspicious

On September 11th, US financial regulators released draft guidelines that could classify routine Bitcoin activities—like self-custody, peer-to-peer swaps, and the use of privacy-enhancing tools—as potentially “suspicious” under anti-money laundering rules. The proposal aims to expand reporting requirements for financial institutions, potentially requiring them to flag transactions involving non-custodial wallets or mixers, even if no illicit activity is evident. This has sparked some outrage among Bitcoiners, who see it as an overreach that undermines Bitcoin’s fundamental principles of sovereignty and permissionlessness.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="New Suspicious Bitcoin Regulations.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

If enacted, these rules could complicate everyday usage of bitcoin for those who are new to it, by pushing many of them toward compliance through less private or safe options. Bitcoiners are already pushing back on this, since self-custody is *essential* for financial freedom, and it's not inherently risky. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it resilient against these measures, but staying informed and supporting privacy-focused tools will help you stay resilient, despite the threat of regulatory pressures.

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

One of Bitcoin’s most mind-blowing effects is how it not only reshapes the world from the outside-*in*, but also transforms us from the inside-*out*. Bitcoin usage gradually reorients the user's mind toward a lower time preference, which means **choosing to delay immediate rewards for far greater benefits in the future.** In inflationary money systems, where savings erode over time, people are pushed to quickly spend their money on fleeting pleasures or cheap, low-quality goods just to stay ahead of rising prices. This creates a vicious cycle of instant gratification, where long-term planning feels futile because tomorrow’s money will always buy less than today’s.

Bitcoin flips this dynamic with its absolute scarcity, capped at just under 21 million coins, and its unbreakable protocol, enabling it to build purchasing power as demand for it surges worldwide. Hodling bitcoin rewards patience, as its value steadily rises against goods and services, motivating users to cut back on impulsive buys and stack more sats for later. This internal shift unfolds slowly, as people accumulate sats and see their wealth not just hold steady against inflation, but actually expand in real terms without the endless hustle.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Time Preference Spectrum.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

When individuals get paid for their work, and then rewarded even more for holding off on consuming the fruits of their labor, they gain the freedom to pursue civilization-building goals, like raising families or adopting healthier lifestyles. In a system where costs fall over time, businesses can offer goods and services with lasting quality. As societies begin shedding the weight of nonstop consumption, they turn instead toward innovation, and start delivering enduring impacts rather than quick fixes.

Bitcoin’s fixed supply isn’t merely a clever financial rule that nudges users toward wise stewardship and visionary thinking; it realigns human incentives and harmonizes our deepest goals with the unchangeable laws of nature. People start cherishing their time for pursuits that echo through eternity, forging wealth that uplifts generations yet unborn. This is why Bitcoiners like to say “Bitcoin fixes this” in response to many of the world’s problems, and why “fix the money, fix the world” rings so true—because Bitcoin first fixes its users, and then its users fix the world.

Recommended Resource
--------------------

Want to learn more about Bitcoin, but are unsure where to begin? You can always complete our [New to Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/new-to-bitcoin) course, but if you're looking for something different, here's our suggested educational resource for this week:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6PG-l7SHf8" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="How Bitcoin Rewires Your Brain.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

In this video, Matthew Kratter (of *Trader* University, before he changed its name to *Bitcoin* University) explains what time preference is, and how Bitcoin rewires your brain to think in more long-term ways, incentivizing us to be more responsible, hard working, and ethical members of society. If it seems a little weird that an unchangeable digital money could change you, then you definitely need to watch this video.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

Just before I started preparing this issue of The Bitcoin Chatt, I listened to a video by BTC Sessions, in which he responded to the assassination of the well-known political activist, Charlie Kirk. One doesn't have to agree with his politics to understand that this was a major tragedy, committed (and cheered on) by some of the most evil people on Earth. In the episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BTCSessions" target="_blank">BTC Sessions</a>, its host, Ben Perrin, invited Brandon Quittem on as a guest to talk about the idea of the Four Turnings. He does a great job, and you can watch the whole discussion below:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfh6TWmIIfI" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="BTC Sessions Charlie Kirk.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

The Four Turnings theory outlines how societies cycle through four phases every 80-90 years, or about the length of a human lifespan. These are: a **High**, with strong institutions and post-crisis unity; an **Awakening**, where cultural shifts challenge norms; an **Unraveling**, with fading trust and rising divides; and a **Crisis**, the Fourth Turning, where old systems collapse, setting the stage for renewal. Generational dynamics drive these cycles, as each age group’s experiences shape their worldview.

We’re deep in a Fourth Turning now, ignited by the 2008 financial crisis that exposed economic weaknesses and sparked ongoing instability. This Crisis, likely spanning from 2008 to somewhere around 2028 to 2030, is marked by accelerating chaos, and forces rapid change. The assassination of Charlie Kirk, a fierce advocate for truth and freedom, is a gut-wrenching loss in these turbulent times, and my heart goes out to his loved ones and everyone else who's grieving.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="The Cycle Continues.gif" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<Br>

The "hard times" we've been facing are undeniable: the lockdowns of 2020, unrest, and loss of trust in authorities only deepened the fractures our world was already suffering from, to say nothing of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the violent revolutions in Nepal and elsewhere. It's hard to keep up with it all, whether mentally or emotionally, but we need to process the pain we feel and continue to uphold the principles of absolute truth and individual sovereignty. Sometimes this Fourth Turning feels like it will never end, but it’s a crucible that's transforming and preparing us and our children for the beginning of the next cycle.

That's where I see some hope for the future. In these trying times, Bitcoin’s unyielding strength offers us a tool to reclaim sovereignty and rebuild trust. By hodling to our values—truth, freedom, and responsibility—and our sats, we can navigate this chaos and emerge stronger on the other side. The Fourth Turning’s end promises renewal, a chance to forge a world rooted in integrity and hope, where our children inherit a future shaped by our steadfast commitment to these principles. So keep calm and hodl on! The dawn of a brighter day is closer than it seems.
