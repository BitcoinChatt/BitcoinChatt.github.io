Global Bitcoin News

### They're Saying the Quiet Part Out Loud

Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, had this to say: *"The end of the Bretton Woods Era of the 1970s fundamentally changed the conduct of monetary policy, as policymakers had to understand the effects of potentially more volatile movements of the U.S. dollar on American families and businesses."* Watch more of this segment <a href="https://x.com/pete_rizzo_/status/1929591314636533795" target="_blank">here</a>.

Why does this matter? As the CEO of Strike and Twenty One, Jack Mallers, put it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxcZwtsVaw4" target="_blank">"They're saying the quiet part out loud."</a> Bitcoiners—to say nothing of gold bugs and libertarians—have been talking about this for years, pointing out that ever since the United States' monetary system disconnected from gold in 1971, everything in our society has gotten much, much worse. But for decades, this has been a topic that Keynesians at all levels have swept under the rug or pretended didn't matter...until now. They've been saying that the iceberg won't sink this ship, but now as the bow gets submerged, they're changing their tune.

### Trump's "Truth Social" Files for a Bitcoin ETF

On June 3rd and again on the 5th, Trump Media and Technology Group—the company behind Truth Social and majority-owned by Donald Trump—filed to launch the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, and now awaits a decision from the SEC, which is expected by January 2026. As with all ETFs, this will allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements through stock exchanges without actually owning any bitcoin.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Truth Social Bitcoin ETF.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

It cannot be stressed enough that these ETFs are merely IOUs. Satoshi created Bitcoin to be a bearer asset that you don't have to trust anyone to hold for you, but ETFs require trust by design. That may be a worthwhile risk to some people, but if you wish to be truly sovereign, then it's best to manage your own Bitcoin private key (12 or 24 random English words), ideally generated on a hardware device that is never connected to the internet. This ETF announcement, however, is still good news for Bitcoin, since it shows that wealthy players like President Trump are feeling the FOMO and gradually learning more about Bitcoin.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="ETF IOU.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

For their sakes, we wish they would learn about self-custody instead of relying on old systems like ETFs, but some people have to touch the stove before they'll learn...

### Bitcoin Blocks Surpass 900,000

At 1:41AM on Friday, <a href="https://mempool.space/block/000000000000000000010538edbfd2d5b809a33dd83f284aeea41c6d0d96968a" target="_blank">Block 900,000</a> was added to the Bitcoin Timechain. Each block is like a "page" in Bitcoin's ledger, with recent transactions and an encoded version of the previous block (called a "hash") embedded in each one. As more blocks are found only after provable work is done, all transactions in previous blocks become more difficult to change, adding to the security of the whole network.

<a href="https://mempool.space/block/000000000000000000010538edbfd2d5b809a33dd83f284aeea41c6d0d96968a" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Over 900000.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

From the perspective of Bitcoin's protocol, there's no significance to the 900,000th block being found; it's merely a nice round number that us humans find significant. As of the writing of this newsletter, there are now less than 100,000 blocks left until Bitcoin's 1,000,000th block, which is currently projected to be found sometime around <a href="https://timechaincalendar.com/en/block/1000000" target="_blank">the beginning of May, 2027</a>.

And from the protocol's perspective, the next major milestone will be at <a href="https://timechaincalendar.com/en/block/1050000" target="_blank">block 1,050,000</a>, when the reward of newly mined bitcoin will halved from the current rate of 3.125 bitcoin with each block to 1.5625 new bitcoin with each block, making it even harder to acquire mine bitcoin. This is currently projected to occur in early April of 2028.

Your Bitcoin Tip

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

As mentioned above, in the news about the ETF filing from the Trump Media and Technology Group, exposure to bitcoin is not the same as owning bitcoin, since trust is required with ETFs, but not with Bitcoin itself. The same is true for holding bitcoin on Cash App, Venmo, and PayPal. For all of these, you're not really holding bitcoin, but only a claim to some bitcoin, which the business may or may not honor. It's also not possible for ordinary users to verify whether such services have all the bitcoin they say they have; if they don't, it would effectively make Bitcoin's price act as if its total supply were more than 21 million, artificially suppressing its price despite rising demand.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="not your keys.gif" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

Fortunately, it's easy to hold actual bitcoin, without needing to trust anyone. All you need is <a href="https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/new-to-bitcoin/exchanges-and-wallets/" target="_blank">a wallet app or device</a> that can generate its own private key, and paper and pen, so you can write down the private key (never store it online!). Your private key will be 12 or 24 random English words, so they'll be easy to store in a secure location, or even in your head, if you need to. With the way that Bitcoin works, it's important to remember that, for all intents and purposes, your private key is your bitcoin!

Why is this the case? In cryptography, any information can be run through an algorithm to then appear as a new dataset. If you have the first dataset, you can easily regenerate the new one, but if you only have the new dataset, then it's impossible to find the original one without a lot of guessing and checking. The following video explains it well, using an analogy of mixing paint colors:

<a href="https://youtu.be/d_FU9tZIo10" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Cryptography Colors.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

In Bitcoin, your private key is required to approve, or "sign", transactions. So if you can write it down, and keep it safe from theft, flood, and fire, then you can hold your own bitcoin, without needing to trust anyone else to hold it for you.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

I visited several businesses this week, and spoke with business owners about Bitcoin Chatt, and gave them <a href="https://bitcoin.rocks/business/" target="_blank">pamphlets</a> about why they should consider accepting bitcoin for payments. Many of them had <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en" target="_blank">Square terminals</a>, and I enjoyed telling them that later this year or early next year, they will be able to start accepting bitcoin at those terminals without changing anything they're already doing.

<a href="https://bitcoin.rocks/business/" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Bitcoin is Good for Busines.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

I encountered something else, though. I've met and spoken with many people around Chattanooga about Bitcoin, and among those who don't own any yet, the #1 reason they gave me for it has been fear and nervousness about doing something wrong. At least, that's what they said. What I've discovered is that there's a much simpler reason, but it's one that keeps them from looking any closer at Bitcoin.

This reason is simply that they don't see a need for owing bitcoin yet. Yes, they've seen Bitcoin's price rise, but they think they're too late to experience massive gains, or they don't think they have any money they can put away for for 4+ years. And they also know that Bitcoin is uncensorable, but since they aren't rocking the boat and would prefer not to, they see no need to jump through hoops to use an unfamiliar type of money, when dollars are working just fine for them.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Need to Know Basis.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

To be perfectly honest, this got me a little down. How can we ever build a bitcoin circular economy here if only a few see its importance, and even fewer want to use it as money? I struggled with this question, until I remembered the essay called <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1936/06/isaiahs-job/652293/" target="_blank">Isaiah's Job</a>, by Albert Jay Nock, and a Bitcoin-focused series that refers to it, called <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoiners-are-the-remnant" target="_blank">Bitcoiners Are The Remnant, The Masses Don’t Matter</a>, by <a href="https://x.com/SvetskiWrites" target="_blank">Aleksandar Svetski</a>. They're each lengthy but absolutely worth reading, and the crux of each is this: our job is not to convince everyone of Bitcoin's importance, or even anyone; it's to find those who are already searching, and are ready—as Obi-wan Kenobi would put it—to take their first step into a larger world.

And so I will continue to press forward, talking with as many business owners as I can, and teaching about Bitcoin to anyone who will listen. I know that to outside observers, it probably seems like a pointless way to spend my time, but to those who know how Bitcoin realigns our incentives, and all the life-changing truths we find as a result of that realignment, this is one of the most worthwhile endeavors we can be involved in.
