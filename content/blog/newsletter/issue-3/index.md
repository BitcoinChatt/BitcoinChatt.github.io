### The Monthly Bitcoin Chatt Meetup

Last week, Bitcoin Chattanooga gathered at <a href="https://theagorafoodclub.com/" target="_blank">The Agora</a> for our monthly meetup. Here's a recap of what was discussed:

<a href="https://theagorafoodclub.com/" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="The Agora Entrance.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

It was a small gathering of 4, including Bitcoin Chattanooga's Founder, Jason Sellers. Jason has suffered from psoriasis for almost 30 years, and since it was much more prominent than at previous meetups, it quickly became the topic of conversation. He is regularly meeting with <a href="https://www.divinedesignnaturalhealth.com/about/dr-brett-spradlin" target="_blank">Dr. Brett Spradlin</a> at <a href="https://www.divinedesignnaturalhealth.com/" target="_blank">Divine Design Natural Health</a> to permanently heal the underlying cause of the psoriasis at its source, and it was expected from the beginning that this process would temporarily make his condition worse before making it better, so everything is going according to plan.

This opened up a discussion about fiat food, or substances that are eaten but have either low or no nutritional value, and how that is a direct result of monetary inflation. After all, if you sold nutritious food, but money printing raised costs for your business, and you had to choose between keeping your prices low while lowering the food's quality and staying competitive, or raising your prices while keeping the food's quality high and getting out-competed by those who chose the first option, what would you choose? Most chose the first one, which is why the metaphorical money printer is the cause of bad health not only in the US, but globally, just as it's the cause of pretty much everything else that's wrong in the world. Fortunately, Bitcoin fixes this.

From there, we talked about a quote from "Utopia or Oblivion", by R. Buckminster Fuller, which showed that even back in the 1960s, he understood the importance of money that's based on proof of work. Henry Ford similarly thought of a future "energy money", as explained in this article way back on December 4th, 1921:

<br>

Later, Jason was asked some very direct questions about how he's supporting his family while Bitcoin Chattanooga's [donations](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/donate/) have been small and infrequent. Jason made it clear that he prefers to keep his own personal finances private, but he also intends to be very open and public about Bitcoin Chatt's finances. So he explained that he and his family are living off their savings for the time being, which are staying completely separate from Bitcoin Chatt's funds. He was asked regarding how long he can keep running this nonprofit before needing to return to a regular job, and while he declined to give a direct answer, Jason assured the attendees that he has a plan, whether Bitcoin Chattanooga starts bringing in regular revenue, or not. Until he needs to change course, though, he plans to keep pressing forward with the mission to create a Bitcoin circular economy in the Chattanooga area.

The discussion then transitioned to bitcoin debit and credit cards, such as from <a href="https://use.foldapp.com/sign-up?referral=AFUAT9R3" target="_blank">Fold</a>, how government regulations could affect Bitcoin, both for good and bad, both in the present and their unintended repercussions in the future. And then the conversation wrapped-up by talking about the pros and cons of getting a loan with one's bitcoin as collateral.

That's a basic overview of what was discussed at the Bitcoin Chatt meetup. Everyone present has been a Bitcoiner for a while, but they're still learning more every day. So if you're new to Bitcoin, the in-person meetups are the place to ask your questions and get the best answers, all while getting to know other Bitcoiners in the area. We'd love to see you there, so check out our [calendar](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/calendar/) for details.

Global Bitcoin News
-------------------

### Bitcoin's Price Reached a New All-Time High!

On Wednesday, May 21st, Bitcoin's price surpassed its previous all-time high of approximately $109K, which it reached back on January 20th. As of the writing of this newsletter, Bitcoin's latest all-time high is roughly $112K.

**Two things** are important to remember during times like these:

1.  **You don't need to buy a whole bitcoin.** Each one can be divided into 100 million satoshis, or "sats", so even at the all-time high, $1 could get you 893 sats.
2.  **You're still** ***incredibly*** **early to Bitcoin.** These new highs are rookie numbers. There's ever-rising demand for an uninflatable, incorruptible, and permissionless money, but the total supply is fixed at just under 21 million. With Bitcoin's total market cap only about 1/500th of all the current value in the world, Bitcoin has a ***lot*** of upside ahead of it!

### Texas Legislature Passes Bitcoin Reserve Bill

The Texas House of Representatives passed Senate Bill 21 (SB 21) with a 105-23 vote, advancing the creation of a state-managed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This makes Texas the third U.S. state to pursue such a measure, following New Hampshire and Arizona. The bill garnered bipartisan support, and is now awaiting a final Senate concurrence vote, before heading to Governor Greg Abbott to sign or veto it.

This legislative move aims to position Texas as a leader in Bitcoin adoption, with the possibility of initially buying tens of millions of dollars' worth in Bitcoin. It will require the state comptroller to manage the reserve, with oversight from an advisory committee of Bitcoin experts, and mandates biennial reports on holdings and value.

It's only a matter of time before state legislatures in both Tennessee and Georgia follow in the footsteps of Texas, Arizona, and New Hampshire. If they're creating strategic bitcoin reserves, don't you think you should, too?

Your Bitcoin Tip
----------------

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

There are many ways to send and receive bitcoin, but the two most popular are on-chain (the original way to transact with bitcoin) and the Lightning Network. "On-chain" refers to permanently embedding your transaction on Bitcoin's ledger, the Timechain (commonly known as the "blockchain"), after first broadcasting it to the whole network and pledging to pay the miners a small fee for confirming and securing it. The Lightning Network relies on the Timechain, but enables bitcoin to be sent instantaneously, privately, and cheaply (or even for free).

Sometimes it's best to send/receive bitcoin on-chain, and other times it's best to do so over Lightning. How can you decide which method to use? To answer this question, there are couple important points to consider:

1.  **The amount you're sending.** Lightning uses "channels" between any 2 network participants, and the connections to other network nodes, as well as the amount of bitcoin in each channel—especially how much is on each side of each channel—will determine how much can be sent. Bottom line: A good rule of thumb is that small purchases—such as anything below $100's worth—can be sent on Lightning, as long as you're using a wallet that's compatible with Lightning. But for larger transactions, it's typically best to broadcast it onto the Timechain.
2.  **Transaction traffic.** Before a transaction gets permanently added to Bitcoin's public ledger, it gets broadcast to those who run Bitcoin's protocol, and they add it to their list of pending transactions, known as the "mempool". These pending transactions are not organized according to "first come, first serve", but according to the sender's chosen fee rate, as measured in sats/<a href="https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/new-to-bitcoin/glossary/#vbyte" target="_blank">vbyte</a>. Sometimes mempools are nearly empty, and you can get your transaction confirmed and permanently added to the Timechain after paying only 1 sat for every vbyte in the record or your transaction. But other times, mempools are congested, wait times are long, and it can become expensive if you're in a hurry to get your transaction confirmed. Those are when you'll likely want to use the Lightning Network even more, so it's a good idea to prepare for that whenever fees are low.

A great resource for checking on the current level of mempool congestion is called <a href="https://mempool.space/" target="_blank">mempool.space</a>. You can also use this tool to explore all on-chain transactions there, all the way back to the Genesis Block, which was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto on January 3rd, 2009.

Recommended Resource
--------------------

Want to learn more about Bitcoin, but are unsure where to begin? You can always complete our [New to Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/new-to-bitcoin) course, but if you're looking for something different, here's our suggested educational resource for this week:

<a href="https://youtu.be/YtFOxNbmD38" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="What's The Problem.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

"What's the Problem" expertly outlines exactly what the problems are that Bitcoin solves, and why a bank's or government's ability to print more money leads to a host of other problems, many of which we don't normally see as direct results of money printing. This video is essential for anyone who wants to understand bitcoin and why it's important.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

Bitcoin is in all-time high territory again, which can sometimes lead to euphoria for both long-term hodlers and newbies alike. These times are the most important—and most difficult—times to remember to not get ahead of ourselves, and remember that while Bitcoin's rising price is nice, **it's the least important part of Bitcoin.** The mantra "Stay humble; stack sats" is often repeated during bull markets. The "stack sats" part is easy; it's the "stay humble" part that all of us struggle with.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Stay Humble Stack Sats.gif" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

What does it mean to stay humble? As I said above, remembering to not get ahead of ourselves is part of it, but that's more of a result of humility, not the essence of the quality itself. At its core, *humility is the ability to be taught,* whether by others or simply by life's experiences. It's an approach to the world with a child-like wonder, always interested in whatever might come next. It's closely related to having a low time preference (i.e., delaying gratification to a later time), but it's not exactly the same.

If "Pride goes before destruction" (<a href="https://www.esv.org/verses/Proverbs16:18/" target="_blank">Proverbs 16:18</a>, ESV), then one could say that humility goes before success. In the Bitcoin space, we like to say "Bitcoin fixes this", and in many ways that's true. But in many more ways, Bitcoin only fixes anything because it first incentivizes us to be humble and to lower our time preference, which then leads us to fix whatever needs fixing! But even then, we must be careful to not congratulate ourselves or compare ourselves to anyone else, or else we'll end up sabotaging the very success we had only obtained through humility.

That's the real reason why I'm into Bitcoin. Replacing the old system of fraud and manipulation with a new system of truth and work is great and all, but watching Bitcoin gradually change the hearts of those who use it—especially my own!—simply through its natural incentives, is where I find true joy, my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai" target="_blank">*ikigai*</a>.

Until next time,

Jason
