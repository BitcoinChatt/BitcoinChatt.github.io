### The Last Issue of The Bitcoin Chatt Newsletter

There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin, and there will also never be more than 21 issues of The Bitcoin Chatt newsletter. Admittedly, this was not the plan from the beginning, but recent (and likely upcoming) changes to Jason's life will make additional issues of this series impossible. He will explain more details in the Closing Thoughts below.

<br>

It has been a wild 21 weeks of Bitcoin news, education, and opinions! It's unfortunate that this is the last one, but the time is right to say goodbye to this part of Bitcoin Chatt. This and all other issues of this newsletter will be publicly available on Bicoin Chatt's [blog](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/blog/), so you'll always be able to look back, and new visitors will be able to catch up on the most important parts of these emails.

There are plans to create a static, 21-part educational email series, however. If Jason is able to create it, it will primarily be for those who are new to Bitcoin, and take them through the basics, so that by the end of the 21st email, they'll have all the tools and knowledge about Bitcoin that they'll ever need. So stay tuned for an announcement about that in the coming months!

### Bitcoin Chatt's 4th Anniversary Party

As was mentioned in the last few newsletters, October 1st marks four years since Bitcoin Chatt started, and we're throwing a party next week, on October 4th, from 12-2 PM, at the Bitcoin Remnant meetup. Hosted at <a href="https://www.divinedesignnaturalhealth.com/" target="_blank">Divine Design Natural Health</a>, located at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CRXP4G9pMN2Qx8fEA" target="_blank">3800 Keith St NW in Cleveland</a>, the event will feature healthy food, a presentation about Bitcoin Chatt, and videos explaining Bitcoin. We'll even have some Bitcoin board games for whoever is interested.

<br>

Whether you've been with us since the beginning or you just joined recently, we invite you to come celebrate what we've built together. We'll recap highlights from these four years, like growing from a tiny group meeting at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/imzCFdHr66nwPA3s7" target="_blank">Edney Building</a> to fostering a bitcoin circular economy here in Chattanooga. If you're planning on being there, you'll need to contribute $10 per person, in cash or bitcoin, to cover the cost of food. RSVP on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/bitcoin-chattanooga/events/310897229/" target="_blank">Meetup.com</a> so we can plan accordingly. See you there!

### Fold Partners with Stripe and Visa to Launch their Bitcoin Rewards Credit Card

On September 24th, Bitcoin financial services company <a href="https://use.foldapp.com/sign-up?referral=AFUAT9R3" target="_blank">Fold</a> announced a groundbreaking partnership with Stripe and Visa to launch the Fold Bitcoin Rewards Credit Card, the first credit card offering rewards exclusively in bitcoin. Issued on the Visa network and powered by Stripe Issuing, the card provides users with an instant 2% sats back on every purchase, with rewards potentially scaling up to 3.5%, depending on spending tiers. This move makes it easier than ever to earn sats on everyday spending, from groceries to gas, without needing to exchange more fiat for bitcoin.

<a href="https://use.foldapp.com/sign-up?referral=AFUAT9R3" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Fold Credit Card.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

This collaboration is an example of growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin for credit card rewards. It seamlessly bridges legacy finance with a sound money future. Fold's credit card will require no annual fee, and it integrates directly with users' existing spending habits, potentially enabling millions to start accumulating bitcoin without even realizing it at first. As adoption continues to grow, this could accelerate Bitcoin's role in daily life, turning routine transactions into steady sat-stacking, which is perfect for anyone looking to effortlessly grow their savings.

### Apple iMessage Update Enables Direct Bitcoin Sends on iPhone

In a quiet but game-changing update this week, <a href="https://macadamia.cash/" target="_blank">Macadamia Wallet</a> v0.4.0 was released, adding an iMessage extension that lets iPhone users send and receive bitcoin directly within their Messages app. Powered by the Lightning Network and Cashu eCash tokens, transfers between contacts are instant, fee-free, and as easy as sending a text message.

<a href="https://macadamia.cash/" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Macadamia Wallet.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

With over 1.2 *billion^ iPhone users worldwide, this could open the doors for Bitcoin as the peer-to-peer money it was always meant to be. It's also a subtle way to orange pill your friends: this integration builds familiarity, and as more people discover how easy it is to move value without banks, they'll begin to see the power and freedom that Bitcoin offers. If you're an iOS user, install the newest version of <a href="https://macadamia.cash/" target="_blank">Macadamia Wallet</a> and try zapping a few sats to someone you know.

Your Bitcoin Tip
----------------

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

*"Stay humble, stack sats"* is a mantra that's often repeated in the Bitcoin space, especially during bull markets when euphoria is likely to take over. The "stack sats" part is straightforward: consistently acquiring small amounts of bitcoin builds wealth over time, thanks to its fixed supply and ever-rising demand. But staying humble? That's the real challenge. 

Humility isn't about putting yourself down or pretending you're less capable than you are; **it's about maintaining a grounded perspective, recognizing your limits, and being open to learning from everything and everyone around you.** The fiat world rewards fiat mindsets of arrogance, closed-mindedness, and high time preference, but true humility is a quiet strength that keeps you both adaptable and resilient.

C.S. Lewis captured this beautifully when he said, *"True humility is not thinking less of yourself; it is thinking of yourself less."* This shifts the focus from our ego, and onto others and the bigger picture, encouraging us to foster genuine connections and growth. Confucius is quoted as stating, *"Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues,"* and Ralph Waldo Emerson once observed, *"A great man is always willing to be little."* These insights make it clear that humility is a deliberate choice, one that builds character by embracing vulnerability, rather than by clinging to illusions of superiority.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Pride vs Humility.jpg" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

For Bitcoiners, humility means not getting carried away by price pumps or assuming you know everything there is to know. Bitcoin's history is full of price rises and falls, and those who stay humble remember that Bitcoin's "Number-Go-Up technology" is great, but it's ultimately the *least* interesting thing about Bitcoin. What Bitcoin is *really* all about is sovereignty, truth, and fixing our broken world, not getting rich for its own sake or looking down on those who got in later.

Mother Teresa summed-up humility like this: *"If you are humble, nothing will touch you, neither praise nor disgrace, because you know what you are."* For Bitcoiners, this means both ignoring FUD and avoiding hubris, always verifying the truth for yourself, and contributing to the network without seeking the spotlight.

Pride, the opposite of humility, is a poison that destroys each of us from within. As Proverbs warns, *"Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall."* History is littered with examples of this: individuals lose everything while chasing glory, families are torn apart by ego-driven disputes, and nations crumble under cultures crippled by hubris.

Pride clouds our judgment, isolates us from truth, and sets us on paths to ruin, often dragging others down with us. Pride often lures us into scams, making us forget the importance of sound money and spending less than we earn. By rejecting pride and embracing humility, we protect ourselves and those we care about, paving the way for a life aligned with Bitcoin’s promise of freedom and resilience.

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Pride goes before destruction.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

This final Bitcoin Tip is a call for all of us to be more humble with our bitcoin and all other parts of our lives. Let's all do more to listen better, learn endlessly, and lift others up without expecting any reward. If we do this, we'll not only stack sats more effectively, but we'll also build lives that have been forever changed by Bitcoin. This is how we move a little more toward a sounder, freer, and infinitely more connected future.

So stay humble and stack sats, everyone. The future of humanity *literally* depends on it.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Time to Say Goodbye.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

Other than my immediate family members, I didn't tell anyone else that this would be the last Bitcoin Chatt newsletter. I think I first considered ending this back in early August, but a couple weeks ago I knew it was time to sunset this permanently. To those who look forward to these emails every Saturday morning, I'm very sorry. But as I said above, I might create a static, 21-part, purely educational email series that takes the reader from the very basics about Bitcoin, all the way to self-custody, using a hardware wallet, and running a node. But at this point I'm not sure if I'll have the time to work on it, or when it might be done. But expect an email from me if I'm able to move forward with that.

The biggest reason for stopping here, other than 21 being an important number in Bitcoin, is the time it takes to prepare this each week, which is about to be compounded by having *even less* time than I already do. I'm working on getting a job, ideally in the Bitcoin space, but I'm not opposed to working elsewhere, like with the cleaning job I briefly tried. I've given a lot of time, energy, and money to building a bitcoin circular economy in the Chattanooga area, and I intend to keep doing that, but it will have to be at a slower pace. 

Anyone who knows me well knows that I doubt myself a lot, and these last several months have absolutely *inundated* me with reasons to doubt myself even more. But, despite that, I would never give up these last 21 weeks for anything in the world, even for all 21 million bitcoin (well, holding all of it would destroy bitcoin's economy, anyway 😉). I have made many mistakes along this journey, some public and others private, but I'm learning from them, so in the end, all of this will turn out to be worth every sat.

Thank you for all your love and support! I hope you enjoyed these last 21 emails, and found a lot of value in them. Remember to keep coming to the meetups (or, for the majority of you, to come for the first time), keep learning, keep teaching others, keep creating a bitcoin circular economy, keep standing for the truth, and keep building a better future for us and especially our posterity. Because that's what Bitcoin is all about.

I look forward to seeing you at the meetups.

Jason
