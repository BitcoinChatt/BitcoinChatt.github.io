### Steak 'n Shake to Start Accepting Bitcoin

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Steak n Sheak Tweet.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

On Thursday, May 8th, Steak 'n Shake [announced on X](https://x.com/SteaknShake/status/1920647356032139430) that they will begin accepting Bitcoin for payments at all their locations, starting on May 16th. They added that this "movement is just beginning," and they're absolutely right:Â as more businesses discover that bitcoin is better for spending and saving than anything else, they'll want to hop aboard the Bitcoin train, too, and reap all the benefits of using truly sound money.

### Bitcoin's Price Surpasses $100K Again

As more individuals, business owners, and even leaders ofÂ nations [learn about Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/new-to-bitcoin/), rising demand chasesÂ Bitcoin's absolutely fixed supply of just under 21 million coins. But even now, Bitcoin's price is still extremely low, as its entire market cap of roughly $2 trillion is only about 1/500th of the total amount of value in the world. So if you think this train has left the station without you, think again: Bitcoin's limited supply will continue to be exchanged for value without limits, so [it's going up forever](https://youtu.be/zTPoRDrtc0s) (even though there will be manyÂ bumps along the way).

Your Bitcoin Tip
----------------

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

Not only will there only ever be just under 21 million coins, they are awarded to the miners (for the work they do to secure transactions) according to a set schedule that can not be sped up or slowed down very much. Why does this matter? With gold, for example, if its price goes up, more people will mine it, which will increase its supply, making its price go back down. But with Bitcoin, as its price goes up and more miners join the network, it automatically adjusts to the influx of new miners every couple weeks, so its issuance rate remains pretty close to what it always was since the beginning. This steady rate of newly mined bitcoin despite its rising demand and number of miners is one reason why Bitcoin's price will keep [going up forever](https://youtu.be/zTPoRDrtc0s).

Recommended Resource
--------------------

Want to learn more about Bitcoin, but are unsure where to begin? You can always complete our [New to Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/new-to-bitcoin/) course, but if you're looking for something different, here's our suggested educational resource for this week:

<img class="mobile-banner" src="Bitcoin Money.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

*Bitcoin Money: A Tale of Bitville Discovering Good Money*Â might be a children's book, but it does a better job of explaining Bitcoin than most other books. If you're looking for a simple, "explain it like I'm 5" kind of book, then you've come to the right place! The author turned the book into a YouTube video, so click the image above to watch the whole thing.

Thoughts from the Founder
-------------------------

And that wraps upÂ our very first newsletter! ðŸŽ‰Â This is an exciting time for BitcoinÂ Chattanooga, but also for humanity in general. Never before have we had a *perfectly* scarce, verifiable, programmable, and incorruptible method for storingÂ and communicating value. And now here we are, with exactly that, and it's called *Bitcoin*.

Throughout history, societies have thrived or collapsed based on the quality of their money. Highly inflationary money always brings with it not only higher prices for goods and services, but also lower quality for those goods and services, to say nothing of the resulting survival mentality and constant quest for instant gratification among its users. On the other hand, societies built on hard money, like gold, have always led to lower prices, higher quality, a discovery mentality, and growing abilities to delay instant gratification for better rewards later. And bitcoin isÂ *infinitely*Â harder than goldâ€”we know its total supply and it can never be changedâ€”so imagine what a world on the bitcoin standard might look like! ðŸ¤¯

Until that day comes, though, our focus needs to beÂ on making that future a reality here in own town of Chattanooga.

Until next week,

Jason
