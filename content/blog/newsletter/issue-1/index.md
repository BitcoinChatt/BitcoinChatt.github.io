### Bitcoin Chattanooga at the City Center Business Expo

On Thursday, May 8th, the Founder of Bitcoin Chattanooga, Jason Sellers, and his son Jason Jr, managed a booth for Bitcoin Chattanooga at the Business Expo at the Waterhouse Pavilion downtown. Many of you reading this newsletter had the opportunity to meet them, subscribe to this newsletter, and even to win some free sats (short for satoshis—small pieces of bitcoin).

An essential part of Bitcoin Chattanooga's mission is not only educating business owners on why they should start accepting bitcoin as payment, but also promoting the businesses that choose to accept bitcoin, so the wider community of Bitcoiners, eager to bring the present closer to the future, can know where to spend their bitcoin. We look forward to working with many businesses in the area, to send them more customers and clients, and to help them save more with bitcoin.

### Bitcoin Game Night at Bargy's

Tentatively*, every Thursday evening, from 7-9pm, we're meeting at Bargy's Cards and Board Games—located at [4079 Cloud Springs Road in Ringgold](https://owrzlll.clicks.mlsend.com/ty/c/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjE1MDI3NjMsXCJsXCI6MTU0MDMyMDcxNjQ0Mjg0MzIzLFwiclwiOjE1NDAzMjEyMDk4ODE3NDMzM30iLCJzIjoiNmUyN2RmZjM5ZDcxOTc0YyJ9)—to play Bitcoin-themed board games.

### Steak 'n Shake to Start Accepting Bitcoin

<img src="Steak n Sheak Tweet.png">

On Thursday, May 8th, Steak 'n Shake [announced on X](https://owrzlll.clicks.mlsend.com/ty/c/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjE1MDI3NjMsXCJsXCI6MTU0MDMyMDcxNjg1MTc4ODAzLFwiclwiOjE1NDAzMjEyMDk4ODE3NDMzM30iLCJzIjoiZjc3MDU4NGJiOGRhN2Q3MyJ9) that they will begin accepting Bitcoin for payments at all their locations, starting on May 16th. They added that this "movement is just beginning," and they're absolutely right: as more businesses discover that bitcoin is better for spending and saving than anything else, they'll want to hop aboard the Bitcoin train, too, and reap all the benefits of using truly sound money.

### Bitcoin's Price Surpasses $100K Again

As more individuals, business owners, and even leaders of nations [learn about Bitcoin](https://owrzlll.clicks.mlsend.com/ty/c/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjE1MDI3NjMsXCJsXCI6MTU0MDMyMDcxNjkwNDIxNjg0LFwiclwiOjE1NDAzMjEyMDk4ODE3NDMzM30iLCJzIjoiMDVlODBkYzg4YjZmYWQyOSJ9), rising demand chases Bitcoin's absolutely fixed supply of just under 21 million coins. But even now, Bitcoin's price is still extremely low, as its entire market cap of roughly $2 trillion is only about 1/500th of the total amount of value in the world. So if you think this train has left the station without you, think again: Bitcoin's limited supply will continue to be exchanged for value without limits, so [it's going up forever](https://owrzlll.clicks.mlsend.com/ty/c/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjE1MDI3NjMsXCJsXCI6MTU0MDMyMDcxNjk1NjY0NTY1LFwiclwiOjE1NDAzMjEyMDk4ODE3NDMzM30iLCJzIjoiZmIzZDVmNmRhNWE3YmZmNyJ9) (even though there will be many bumps along the way).

Your Bitcoin Tip
----------------

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

Not only will there only ever be just under 21 million coins, they are awarded to the miners (for the work they do to secure transactions) according to a set schedule that can not be sped up or slowed down very much. Why does this matter? With gold, for example, if its price goes up, more people will mine it, which will increase its supply, making its price go back down. But with Bitcoin, as its price goes up and more miners join the network, it automatically adjusts to the influx of new miners every couple weeks, so its issuance rate remains pretty close to what it always was since the beginning. This steady rate of newly mined bitcoin despite its rising demand and number of miners is one reason why Bitcoin's price will keep [going up forever](https://owrzlll.clicks.mlsend.com/ty/c/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjE1MDI3NjMsXCJsXCI6MTU0MDMyMDcxNzM2NTU5MDM4LFwiclwiOjE1NDAzMjEyMDk4ODE3NDMzM30iLCJzIjoiNTlkNmEzYzRlZGNkM2QxZiJ9).

*Bitcoin Money: A Tale of Bitville Discovering Good Money* might be a children's book, but it does a better job of explaining Bitcoin than most other books.

Thoughts from the Founder
-------------------------

And that wraps up our very first newsletter! 🎉 This is an exciting time for Bitcoin Chattanooga, but also for humanity in general. Never before have we had a *perfectly* scarce, verifiable, programmable, and incorruptible method for storing and communicating value. And now here we are, with exactly that, and it's called *Bitcoin*.

Throughout history, societies have thrived or collapsed based on the quality of their money. Highly inflationary money always brings with it not only higher prices for goods and services, but also lower quality for those goods and services, to say nothing of the resulting survival mentality and constant quest for instant gratification among its users. On the other hand, societies built on hard money, like gold, have always led to lower prices, higher quality, a discovery mentality, and growing abilities to delay instant gratification for better rewards later. And bitcoin is *infinitely* harder than gold—we know its total supply and it can never be changed—so imagine what a world on the bitcoin standard might look like! 🤯

<img src="../FTM FTW.gif">

Until that day comes, though, our focus needs to be on making that future a reality here in own town of Chattanooga.

Until next week,

Jason
