### BitcoinÂ Chatt Flyers!

We're getting the word out about Bitcoin Chatt in anyÂ way we know how (as long as it's not too expensive ðŸ˜…), including old-school methods like these flyers. Back in September 2021, when Jason Sellers was first getting Bitcoin Chatt started as a local meetup, he printed flyers from home on full 8.5"x11"Â sheets ofÂ paper, and distributed them around town, but they didn't look half as good as this!

Know any good public areas where we can distribute more of these? Tell us, and we'll get some flyers there ASAP!

### Bitcoin Remnant is Now on Meetup.com!

The BitcoinÂ Remnant meetups have now been added to the Bitcoin Chattanooga events listed on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/bitcoin-chattanooga/events/308482696/" target="_blank">Meetup.com</a>. Please ignore that it lists Jason as the host; these gatherings will still be hosted byÂ Dr. Brett Spradlin at Divine Design Natural Health every first Saturday of the month. Please RSVP each month, so he will have a good idea of the number of people to expect.

<br>

Please note, however, that there was an error in last week's newsletter, regarding upcoming events: **there will** ***not*** **be a BitcoinÂ Remnant meetup on July 5th,** due to the holiday weekend and Dr. Spradlin's unavailabilityÂ at that time.

Global Bitcoin News

### The Opportunity Cost Bowser Extension

Earlier this week, <a href="https://x.com/MartyBent" target="_blank">Marty Bent</a> unveiled a new browser extension that he and his team have been working on, called <a href="https://www.opportunitycost.app/" target="_blank">Opportunity Cost</a>. This extension, which is open source and keeps your data completelyÂ private,Â works on Chrome, Brave, and soon Firefox. It looks for any fiat prices in your browser window, and then adds the current equivalent price in bitcoin next to it. Over time, while you'll see the prices in dollars slowly creep upward, you'll see the prices in bitcoin gradually fall lower.

<a href="https://www.opportunitycost.app/demo.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Opportunity Cost Extension.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

The stated purpose forÂ Opportunity CostÂ is to show you how much bitcoin you could stack or saveÂ insteadÂ of purchasingÂ the item(s) you're thinking of buying, thereby helping you to "Spend smarter. Stack harder." This is great, and very much needed in our consumer-driven culture, but Opportunity Cost has another benefit: laying the groundwork for making bitcoin a Unit of Account. Money is like language, so having a "translator"â€”showing us the price of everything in both fiat and bitcoinâ€”is essential for training our minds to think in terms of bitcoin.

### Connecticut Bans State Bitcoin Holdings

While some states are passing bills to create a reserve of the most valuable asset ever, Connecticut passed <a href="[URL here]" target="_blank">HB7082</a> this week, which prohibits the state from accepting, holding, or investing in bitcoin (or any other digital currency).

<img class="mobile-banner" src="HFSP Connecticut.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;">

<br>

To those of usÂ who want greater bitcoin adoption, this might seem like a setback. But adoption is inevitable, even if it takes a long time,Â and the longer the state and other entities that areÂ close to the money printer take to finally figure that out, the more time you will have to build <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rnqst5qCgA" target="_blank">generational wealth</a>. Bitcoin was made to separate money from state, and clearly, it seems thatÂ some governments,Â like Connecticut's,Â will do that on their own, without anyÂ help from us.

Your Bitcoin Tip

### This Week's Essential Bitcoin Knowledge

The question is often asked:Â "Could Bitcoin survive an apocalyptic scenario? If a huge solar flare takes out all electronics, or if quantum computing can someday crack Bitcoin's cryptography, then what happens to Bitcoin?"

The short answer is yes, Bitcoin can survive anÂ apocalyptic scenario, whether it be a solar flare, a nuclear holocaust, quantum computing, or anything else. Why? The short answer to that question is that people can keep Bitcoin running, as long as they hold to its ideology of, as Michael Saylor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyoONj4nEY&t=4423s" target="_blank">put it</a>,Â *"sovereignty, truth, [and] thermodynamic soundness."* So, given theÂ incentives that Bitcoin aligns, as long as there is still anyone around who knows about Bitcoin, Bitcoin can continue to function through any catastrophe.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hyoONj4nEY&t=4423s" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="Saylor Bitcoin Ideology.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

Now, that's not to say a situation like that wouldÂ be easy. As explained a couple weeks ago, Bitcoin's human element, its game theory, is the part that relies on us to keep it going, even in the best of times. But many Bitcoiners have already created ways to use Bitcoin independently ofÂ the internet, electricity, and other systems.Â These solutions include <a href="https://opendime.com/" target="_blank">OpenDimes</a>, <a href="https://satscard.com/" target="_blank">Satscards</a>, <a href="https://blockstream.com/satellite/" target="_blank">Blockstream Satellites</a>,Â <a href="https://github.com/startimeahmet/LNMesh" target="_blank">LNMesh</a>, and others.

It's important to understand that, other than complete extinction of all humanity, no problem we face is ever permanent. People have a knack for bouncing back up after falling down, and there'sÂ hardly any placeÂ where that's seen more clearly than in Bitcoin. The protocol can be updated to resist quantum attacks; preloaded OpenDimes and Satscards can be exchanged in person without any electricity or internet; and those who can generate their own electricity could use Blockstream Satellites or LNMeshÂ to transact with others who have access to electricity.

As long as there are people who value self-sovereignty,Â verifiable truth, and thermodynamic soundness, and are willing to put in the work to keep Bitcoin going, then Bitcoin will always keep going.

Recommended Resource
--------------------

Want to learn more about Bitcoin, but are unsure where to begin? You can always complete our [New to Bitcoin](https://www.bitcoinchatt.com/new-to-bitcoin) course, but if you're looking for something different, here's our suggested educational resource for this week:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oksraL7wN6Q" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="God Bless Bitcoin.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

<br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oksraL7wN6Q" target="_blank">*God Bless Bitcoin*</a> is a documentary that asks the timely question: How do we fix our broken money? Through in-depth conversations with bitcoin and interfaith religious leaders, this film exposes the broken, unjust, and immoral nature of our current fiat-based monetary system, one that's intimately connected to the military industrial complex and the propagation of war.

The film also shows how and why members of the poor and middle class feel a financial squeeze even when they work hard and lead fiscally responsible lives. *God Bless Bitcoin* ultimately suggests the ways in which Bitcoin can present alternatives to our current system that are more just, equitable, and peaceful.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

As I'm writing these words, news is coming in about Israel bombing Iran, Iran retaliating, and the Trump administration's support of Israel's preemptive strike. This is not in any way a political newsletter, so IÂ don't want to go too deeply into itÂ here, but this recent turn of events has given me a lot to think about.

War is expensive; it always has been, and always will be. So where is Israelâ€”not to mention the United Statesâ€”getting the money to fund this conflict? If they had been attacked, it might be politically popular to tax the people to provide for their defense. But that's not what's happening here, nor has it been happeningÂ for a very long time. The writers of theÂ Tuttle Twins' song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuboVKBFnl0" target="_blank">"When Money is Controlled, Money is Corrupted,"</a>Â hit the nail on the head:

<p style="text-align: center">
Once upon a time,
when a country went to war,
they'd send the people a war tax
if it was worth fighting for.
If the fighting went on far too long
the people would revolt:
"I'm not paying for your stupid war,
and you have lost my vote!"

Well the government got sneaky,
they knew just what they'd need,
instead of taxing for the war,
they'd print that money secretly!
Then wars could last for decades
and they could do just what they will,
'cause it's funded through inflation,
and you can foot the bill!
</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuboVKBFnl0" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="When Money is Controlled.gif" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

Central banksÂ print money out of thin air to fund wars and other things,Â which of course leads to countless deaths andÂ injuries,Â as well as societalÂ upheaval for everyone involved. But it'sÂ alsoÂ a form of covert theftÂ from everyone in the entire economy at the same time, via dilution of the money supply. The only word IÂ can think of to describe that is evil. IÂ know that may sound extreme to some, but how else would you describe those who lie, steal, and murder on a level never before seen in the history of mankind?

*This* is why we have Bitcoin; this is why many of us put so much time into teaching others about it: **because our time and labor can either support the system of slavery and death or the system of freedom and life.**Â The sooner we can leave the fiat system behind us and start using bitcoin as our money, the better. I know it's not possible to do thatÂ for everything yet, but that's why we need to keep working toward fixing that.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLjCkPuPCVc" target="_blank"><img class="mobile-banner" src="The Race to Avoid the War.png" style="width:30dvw;display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a>

In the video above, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLjCkPuPCVc" target="_blank">The Race to Avoid the War</a>, Swan Bitcoin's CEO, Cory Klippsten, succinctly explains what Bitcoinâ€”and all the coding, stacking, orange pilling, newsletters, meetups, conferences, and everything elseâ€”is all about. We're in a race to avoid a global war that will not necessarily be nation vs. nation, or even nocoiners vs. bitcoiners, but powerful parasites vs. freedom loving plebs. We're racing to escape from the fiat prisons that have been constructed around us, even as the gatesÂ are slowly closing, and many fellow prisoners seek to slow down our escapeÂ with shitcoins and jpegs.

As they say in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKB67KzjO4A" target="_blank">favorite scene</a> inÂ the showÂ *Andor*, there is only ***one. way. out.*** And Bitcoin is that way.
